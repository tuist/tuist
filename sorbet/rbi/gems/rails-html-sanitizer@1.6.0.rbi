# == Rails::HTML4::SafeListSanitizer
#
# Sanitizes HTML4 and CSS from an extensive safe list.
#
# === Whitespace
#
# We can't make any guarantees about whitespace being kept or stripped.  Loofah uses Nokogiri,
# which wraps either a C or Java parser for the respective Ruby implementation.  Those two
# parsers determine how whitespace is ultimately handled.
#
# When the stripped markup will be rendered the users browser won't take whitespace into account
# anyway. It might be better to suggest your users wrap their whitespace sensitive content in
# pre tags or that you do so automatically.
#
# === Options
#
# Sanitizes both html and css via the safe lists found in
# Rails::HTML::Concern::Scrubber::SafeList
#
# SafeListSanitizer also accepts options to configure the safe list used when sanitizing html.
# There's a class level option:
#
#   Rails::HTML4::SafeListSanitizer.allowed_tags = %w(table tr td)
#   Rails::HTML4::SafeListSanitizer.allowed_attributes = %w(id class style)
#
# Tags and attributes can also be passed to +sanitize+.  Passed options take precedence over the
# class level options.
#
# === Examples
#
#   safe_list_sanitizer = Rails::HTML4::SafeListSanitizer.new
#
#   # default: sanitize via a extensive safe list of allowed elements
#   safe_list_sanitizer.sanitize(@article.body)

#   safe_list_sanitizer.sanitize(
#     @article.body,
#     tags: %w(table tr td),
#     attributes: %w(id class style),
#   )
#
#   # sanitize via a custom Loofah scrubber
#   safe_list_sanitizer.sanitize(@article.body, scrubber: ArticleScrubber.new)
#
#   # prune nodes from the tree instead of stripping tags and leaving inner content

# === Rails::HTML::PermitScrubber
#
# +Rails::HTML::PermitScrubber+ allows you to permit only your own tags and/or attributes.
#
# +Rails::HTML::PermitScrubber+ can be subclassed to determine:
# - When a node should be skipped via +skip_node?+.
# - When a node is allowed via +allowed_node?+.
# - When an attribute should be scrubbed via +scrub_attribute?+.
#
# Subclasses don't need to worry if tags or attributes are set or not.
# If tags or attributes are not set, Loofah's behavior will be used.
# If you override +allowed_node?+ and no tags are set, it will not be called.
# Instead Loofahs behavior will be used.
# Likewise for +scrub_attribute?+ and attributes respectively.
#
# Text and CDATA nodes are skipped by default.
# Unallowed elements will be stripped, i.e. element is removed but its subtree kept.
# Supplied tags and attributes should be Enumerables.
#
# +tags=+
# If set, elements excluded will be stripped.
# If not, elements are stripped based on Loofahs +HTML5::Scrub.allowed_element?+.
#
# +attributes=+
# If set, attributes excluded will be removed.
# If not, attributes are removed based on Loofahs +HTML5::Scrub.scrub_attributes+.
