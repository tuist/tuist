# When 'mutex_m' is required, any object that extends or includes Mutex_m will
# be treated like a Mutex.
#
# Start by requiring the standard library Mutex_m:
#
#   require "mutex_m.rb"
#
# From here you can extend an object with Mutex instance methods:
#
#   obj = Object.new
#   obj.extend Mutex_m
#
# Or mixin Mutex_m into your module to your class inherit Mutex instance
# methods --- remember to call super() in your class initialize method.
#
#   class Foo
#     include Mutex_m
#     def initialize
#       # ...
#       super()
#     end
#     # ...
#   end
#   obj = Foo.new
#   # this obj can be handled like Mutex
