# An abstract implementation of local storage, with sub-classes for
# per-thread and per-fiber locals.
#
# Each execution context (EC, thread or fiber) has a lazily initialized array
# of local variable values. Each time a new local variable is created, we
# allocate an "index" for it.
#
# For example, if the allocated index is 1, that means slot #1 in EVERY EC's
# locals array will be used for the value of that variable.
#
# The good thing about using a per-EC structure to hold values, rather than
# a global, is that no synchronization is needed when reading and writing
# those values (since the structure is only ever accessed by a single
# thread).
#
# Of course, when a local variable is GC'd, 1) we need to recover its index
# for use by other new local variables (otherwise the locals arrays could
# get bigger and bigger with time), and 2) we need to null out all the
# references held in the now-unused slots (both to avoid blocking GC of those
# objects, and also to prevent "stale" values from being passed on to a new
# local when the index is reused).
#
# Because we need to null out freed slots, we need to keep references to
# ALL the locals arrays, so we can null out the appropriate slots in all of
# them. This is why we need to use a finalizer to clean up the locals array
# when the EC goes out of scope.

# uncoordinated, *asynchronous* change of individual values. Best used when
# the value will undergo frequent, complex updates. Suitable when the result
# of an update does not need to be known immediately. `Agent` is (mostly)
# functionally equivalent to Clojure's agent, except where the runtime
# prevents parity.
#
# Agents are reactive, not autonomous - there is no imperative message loop
# and no blocking receive. The state of an Agent should be itself immutable
# and the `#value` of an Agent is always immediately available for reading by
# any thread without any messages, i.e. observation does not require
# cooperation or coordination.
#
# Agent action dispatches are made using the various `#send` methods. These
# methods always return immediately. At some point later, in another thread,
# the following will happen:
#
# 1. The given `action` will be applied to the state of the Agent and the
#    `args`, if any were supplied.
# 2. The return value of `action` will be passed to the validator lambda,
#    if one has been set on the Agent.
# 3. If the validator succeeds or if no validator was given, the return value
#    of the given `action` will become the new `#value` of the Agent. See
#    `#initialize` for details.
# 4. If any observers were added to the Agent, they will be notified. See
#    `#add_observer` for details.
# 5. If during the `action` execution any other dispatches are made (directly
#    or indirectly), they will be held until after the `#value` of the Agent
#    has been changed.
#
# If any exceptions are thrown by an action function, no nested dispatches
# will occur, and the exception will be cached in the Agent itself. When an
# Agent has errors cached, any subsequent interactions will immediately throw
# an exception, until the agent's errors are cleared. Agent errors can be
# examined with `#error` and the agent restarted with `#restart`.
#
# The actions of all Agents get interleaved amongst threads in a thread pool.
# At any point in time, at most one action for each Agent is being executed.
# Actions dispatched to an agent from another single agent or thread will
# occur in the order they were sent, potentially interleaved with actions
# dispatched to the same agent from other sources. The `#send` method should
# be used for actions that are CPU limited, while the `#send_off` method is
# appropriate for actions that may block on IO.
#
# Unlike in Clojure, `Agent` cannot participate in `Concurrent::TVar` transactions.
#
# ## Example
#
# ```
# def next_fibonacci(set = nil)
#   return [0, 1] if set.nil?
#   set + [set[-2..-1].reduce{|sum,x| sum + x }]
# end
#
# # create an agent with an initial value
# agent = Concurrent::Agent.new(next_fibonacci)
#
# # send a few update requests
# 5.times do
#   agent.send{|set| next_fibonacci(set) }
# end
#
# # wait for them to complete
# agent.await
#
# # get the current value
# agent.value #=> [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8]
# ```
#
# ## Observation
#
# Agents support observers through the {Concurrent::Observable} mixin module.
# Notification of observers occurs every time an action dispatch returns and
# the new value is successfully validated. Observation will *not* occur if the
# action raises an exception, if validation fails, or when a {#restart} occurs.
#
# When notified the observer will receive three arguments: `time`, `old_value`,
# and `new_value`. The `time` argument is the time at which the value change
# occurred. The `old_value` is the value of the Agent when the action began
# processing. The `new_value` is the value to which the Agent was set when the
# action completed. Note that `old_value` and `new_value` may be the same.
# This is not an error. It simply means that the action returned the same
# value.
#
# ## Nested Actions
#
# It is possible for an Agent action to post further actions back to itself.
# The nested actions will be enqueued normally then processed *after* the
# outer action completes, in the order they were sent, possibly interleaved
# with action dispatches from other threads. Nested actions never deadlock
# with one another and a failure in a nested action will never affect the
# outer action.
#
# Nested actions can be called using the Agent reference from the enclosing
# scope or by passing the reference in as a "send" argument. Nested actions
# cannot be post using `self` from within the action block/proc/lambda; `self`
# in this context will not reference the Agent. The preferred method for
# dispatching nested actions is to pass the Agent as an argument. This allows
# Ruby to more effectively manage the closing scope.
#
# Prefer this:
#
# ```
# agent = Concurrent::Agent.new(0)
# agent.send(agent) do |value, this|
#   this.send {|v| v + 42 }
#   3.14
# end
# agent.value #=> 45.14
# ```
#
# Over this:
#
# ```
# agent = Concurrent::Agent.new(0)
# agent.send do |value|
#   agent.send {|v| v + 42 }
#   3.14
# end
# ```
#
#
# **NOTE** Never, *under any circumstances*, call any of the "await" methods
# ({#await}, {#await_for}, {#await_for!}, and {#wait}) from within an action
# block/proc/lambda. The call will block the Agent and will always fail.
# Calling either {#await} or {#wait} (with a timeout of `nil`) will
# hopelessly deadlock the Agent with no possibility of recovery.

  #
  # The `:validator` option must be `nil` or a side-effect free proc/lambda
  # which takes one argument. On any intended value change the validator, if
  # provided, will be called. If the new value is invalid the validator should
  # return `false` or raise an error.
  #
  # The `:error_handler` option must be `nil` or a proc/lambda which takes two
  # arguments. When an action raises an error or validation fails, either by
  # returning false or raising an error, the error handler will be called. The
  # arguments to the error handler will be a reference to the agent itself and
  # the error object which was raised.
  #
  # The `:error_mode` may be either `:continue` (the default if an error
  # handler is given) or `:fail` (the default if error handler nil or not
  # given).
  #
  # If an action being run by the agent throws an error or doesn't pass
  # validation the error handler, if present, will be called. After the
  # handler executes if the error mode is `:continue` the Agent will continue
  # as if neither the action that caused the error nor the error itself ever
  # happened.
  #
  # If the mode is `:fail` the Agent will become {#failed?} and will stop
  # accepting new action dispatches. Any previously queued actions will be
  # held until {#restart} is called. The {#value} method will still work,

Concurrent::ArrayImplementation = Array

# A mixin module that provides simple asynchronous behavior to a class,
# turning it into a simple actor. Loosely based on Erlang's
# [gen_server](http://www.erlang.org/doc/man/gen_server.html), but without
# supervision or linking.
#
# A more feature-rich {Concurrent::Actor} is also available when the
# capabilities of `Async` are too limited.
#
# ```cucumber
# Feature:
#   As a stateful, plain old Ruby class
#   I want safe, asynchronous behavior
#   So my long-running methods don't block the main thread
# ```
#
# The `Async` module is a way to mix simple yet powerful asynchronous
# capabilities into any plain old Ruby object or class, turning each object
# into a simple Actor. Method calls are processed on a background thread. The
# caller is free to perform other actions while processing occurs in the
# background.
#
# Method calls to the asynchronous object are made via two proxy methods:
# `async` (alias `cast`) and `await` (alias `call`). These proxy methods post
# the method call to the object's background thread and return a "future"
# which will eventually contain the result of the method call.
#
# This behavior is loosely patterned after Erlang's `gen_server` behavior.
# When an Erlang module implements the `gen_server` behavior it becomes
# inherently asynchronous. The `start` or `start_link` function spawns a
# process (similar to a thread but much more lightweight and efficient) and
# returns the ID of the process. Using the process ID, other processes can
# send messages to the `gen_server` via the `cast` and `call` methods. Unlike
# Erlang's `gen_server`, however, `Async` classes do not support linking or
# supervision trees.
#
# ## Basic Usage
#
# When this module is mixed into a class, objects of the class become inherently
# asynchronous. Each object gets its own background thread on which to post
# asynchronous method calls. Asynchronous method calls are executed in the
# background one at a time in the order they are received.
#
# To create an asynchronous class, simply mix in the `Concurrent::Async` module:
#
# ```
# class Hello
#   include Concurrent::Async
#
#   def hello(name)
#     "Hello, #{name}!"
#   end
# end
# ```
#
# Mixing this module into a class provides each object two proxy methods:
# `async` and `await`. These methods are thread safe with respect to the
# enclosing object. The former proxy allows methods to be called
# asynchronously by posting to the object's internal thread. The latter proxy
# allows a method to be called synchronously but does so safely with respect
# to any pending asynchronous method calls and ensures proper ordering. Both
# methods return a {Concurrent::IVar} which can be inspected for the result
# of the proxied method call. Calling a method with `async` will return a
# `:pending` `IVar` whereas `await` will return a `:complete` `IVar`.
#
# ```
# class Echo
#   include Concurrent::Async
#
#   def echo(msg)
#     print "#{msg}\n"
#   end
# end
#
# horn = Echo.new
# horn.echo('zero')      # synchronous, not thread-safe
#                        # returns the actual return value of the method
#
# horn.async.echo('one') # asynchronous, non-blocking, thread-safe
#                        # returns an IVar in the :pending state
#
# horn.await.echo('two') # synchronous, blocking, thread-safe
#                        # returns an IVar in the :complete state
# ```
#
# ## Let It Fail
#
# The `async` and `await` proxy methods have built-in error protection based
# on Erlang's famous "let it fail" philosophy. Instance methods should not be
# programmed defensively. When an exception is raised by a delegated method
# the proxy will rescue the exception, expose it to the caller as the `reason`
# attribute of the returned future, then process the next method call.
#
# ## Calling Methods Internally
#
# External method calls should *always* use the `async` and `await` proxy
# methods. When one method calls another method, the `async` proxy should
# rarely be used and the `await` proxy should *never* be used.
#
# When an object calls one of its own methods using the `await` proxy the
# second call will be enqueued *behind* the currently running method call.
# Any attempt to wait on the result will fail as the second call will never
# run until after the current call completes.
#
# Calling a method using the `await` proxy from within a method that was
# itself called using `async` or `await` will irreversibly deadlock the
# object. Do *not* do this, ever.
#
# ## Instance Variables and Attribute Accessors
#
# Instance variables do not need to be thread-safe so long as they are private.
# Asynchronous method calls are processed in the order they are received and
# are processed one at a time. Therefore private instance variables can only
# be accessed by one thread at a time. This is inherently thread-safe.
#
# When using private instance variables within asynchronous methods, the best
# practice is to read the instance variable into a local variable at the start
# of the method then update the instance variable at the *end* of the method.
# This way, should an exception be raised during method execution the internal
# state of the object will not have been changed.
#
# ### Reader Attributes
#
# The use of `attr_reader` is discouraged. Internal state exposed externally,
# when necessary, should be done through accessor methods. The instance
# variables exposed by these methods *must* be thread-safe, or they must be
# called using the `async` and `await` proxy methods. These two approaches are
# subtly different.
#
# When internal state is accessed via the `async` and `await` proxy methods,
# the returned value represents the object's state *at the time the call is
# processed*, which may *not* be the state of the object at the time the call
# is made.
#
# To get the state *at the current* time, irrespective of an enqueued method
# calls, a reader method must be called directly. This is inherently unsafe
# unless the instance variable is itself thread-safe, preferably using one
# of the thread-safe classes within this library. Because the thread-safe
# classes within this library are internally-locking or non-locking, they can
# be safely used from within asynchronous methods without causing deadlocks.
#
# Generally speaking, the best practice is to *not* expose internal state via
# reader methods. The best practice is to simply use the method's return value.
#
# ### Writer Attributes
#
# Writer attributes should never be used with asynchronous classes. Changing
# the state externally, even when done in the thread-safe way, is not logically
# consistent. Changes to state need to be timed with respect to all asynchronous
# method calls which my be in-process or enqueued. The only safe practice is to
# pass all necessary data to each method as arguments and let the method update
# the internal state as necessary.
#
# ## Class Constants, Variables, and Methods
#
# ### Class Constants
#
# Class constants do not need to be thread-safe. Since they are read-only and
# immutable they may be safely read both externally and from within
# asynchronous methods.
#
# ### Class Variables
#
# Class variables should be avoided. Class variables represent shared state.
# Shared state is anathema to concurrency. Should there be a need to share
# state using class variables they *must* be thread-safe, preferably
# using the thread-safe classes within this library. When updating class
# variables, never assign a new value/object to the variable itself. Assignment
# is not thread-safe in Ruby. Instead, use the thread-safe update functions
# of the variable itself to change the value.
#
# The best practice is to *never* use class variables with `Async` classes.
#
# ### Class Methods
#
# Class methods which are pure functions are safe. Class methods which modify
# class variables should be avoided, for all the reasons listed above.
#
# ## An Important Note About Thread Safe Guarantees
#
# > Thread safe guarantees can only be made when asynchronous method calls
# > are not mixed with direct method calls. Use only direct method calls
# > when the object is used exclusively on a single thread. Use only
# > `async` and `await` when the object is shared between threads. Once you
# > call a method using `async` or `await`, you should no longer call methods
# > directly on the object. Use `async` and `await` exclusively from then on.
#
# @example
#
#   class Echo
#   include Concurrent::Async
#
#   def echo(msg)
#   print "#{msg}\n"
#   end
#   end
#
#   horn = Echo.new
#   horn.echo('zero')      # synchronous, not thread-safe
#   # returns the actual return value of the method
#
#   horn.async.echo('one') # asynchronous, non-blocking, thread-safe
#   # returns an IVar in the :pending state
#
#   horn.await.echo('two') # synchronous, blocking, thread-safe

# Atoms provide a way to manage shared, synchronous, independent state.
#
# An atom is initialized with an initial value and an optional validation
# proc. At any time the value of the atom can be synchronously and safely
# changed. If a validator is given at construction then any new value
# will be checked against the validator and will be rejected if the
# validator returns false or raises an exception.
#
# There are two ways to change the value of an atom: {#compare_and_set} and
# {#swap}. The former will set the new value if and only if it validates and
# the current value matches the new value. The latter will atomically set the
# new value to the result of running the given block if and only if that
# value validates.
#
# ## Example
#
# ```
# def next_fibonacci(set = nil)
#   return [0, 1] if set.nil?
#   set + [set[-2..-1].reduce{|sum,x| sum + x }]
# end
#
# # create an atom with an initial value
# atom = Concurrent::Atom.new(next_fibonacci)
#
# # send a few update requests
# 5.times do
#   atom.swap{|set| next_fibonacci(set) }
# end
#
# # get the current value
# atom.value #=> [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8]
# ```
#
# ## Observation
#
# Atoms support observers through the {Concurrent::Observable} mixin module.
# Notification of observers occurs every time the value of the Atom changes.
# When notified the observer will receive three arguments: `time`, `old_value`,
# and `new_value`. The `time` argument is the time at which the value change
# occurred. The `old_value` is the value of the Atom when the change began
# The `new_value` is the value to which the Atom was set when the change
# completed. Note that `old_value` and `new_value` may be the same. This is
# not an error. It simply means that the change operation returned the same
# value.
#
# Unlike in Clojure, `Atom` cannot participate in {Concurrent::TVar} transactions.
#
#
# ## Thread-safe Variable Classes
#
# Each of the thread-safe variable classes is designed to solve a different
# problem. In general:
#
# * *{Concurrent::Agent}:* Shared, mutable variable providing independent,
#   uncoordinated, *asynchronous* change of individual values. Best used when
#   the value will undergo frequent, complex updates. Suitable when the result

# A thread pool that dynamically grows and shrinks to fit the current workload.
# New threads are created as needed, existing threads are reused, and threads
# that remain idle for too long are killed and removed from the pool. These
# pools are particularly suited to applications that perform a high volume of
# short-lived tasks.
#
# On creation a `CachedThreadPool` has zero running threads. New threads are
# created on the pool as new operations are `#post`. The size of the pool
# will grow until `#max_length` threads are in the pool or until the number
# of threads exceeds the number of running and pending operations. When a new
# operation is post to the pool the first available idle thread will be tasked
# with the new operation.
#
# Should a thread crash for any reason the thread will immediately be removed
# from the pool. Similarly, threads which remain idle for an extended period
# of time will be killed and reclaimed. Thus these thread pools are very
# efficient at reclaiming unused resources.

# The [observer pattern](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern) is one
# of the most useful design patterns.
#
# The workflow is very simple:
# - an `observer` can register itself to a `subject` via a callback
# - many `observers` can be registered to the same `subject`
# - the `subject` notifies all registered observers when its status changes
# - an `observer` can deregister itself when is no more interested to receive
#     event notifications
#
# In a single threaded environment the whole pattern is very easy: the
# `subject` can use a simple data structure to manage all its subscribed
# `observer`s and every `observer` can react directly to every event without
# caring about synchronization.
#
# In a multi threaded environment things are more complex. The `subject` must
# synchronize the access to its data structure and to do so currently we're
# using two specialized ObserverSet: {Concurrent::Concern::CopyOnWriteObserverSet}
# and {Concurrent::Concern::CopyOnNotifyObserverSet}.
#
# When implementing and `observer` there's a very important rule to remember:
# **there are no guarantees about the thread that will execute the callback**
#
# Let's take this example
# ```
# class Observer
#   def initialize
#     @count = 0
#   end
#
#   def update
#     @count += 1
#   end
# end
#
# obs = Observer.new
# [obj1, obj2, obj3, obj4].each { |o| o.add_observer(obs) }
# # execute [obj1, obj2, obj3, obj4]
# ```
#
# `obs` is wrong because the variable `@count` can be accessed by different
# threads at the same time, so it should be synchronized (using either a Mutex
# or an AtomicFixum)

# A synchronization object that allows one thread to wait on multiple other threads.

# Lazy evaluation of a block yielding an immutable result. Useful for
# expensive operations that may never be needed. It may be non-blocking,
# supports the `Concern::Obligation` interface, and accepts the injection of
# custom executor upon which to execute the block. Processing of
# block will be deferred until the first time `#value` is called.
# At that time the caller can choose to return immediately and let
# the block execute asynchronously, block indefinitely, or block
# with a timeout.
#
# When a `Delay` is created its state is set to `pending`. The value and
# reason are both `nil`. The first time the `#value` method is called the
# enclosed opration will be run and the calling thread will block. Other
# threads attempting to call `#value` will block as well. Once the operation
# is complete the *value* will be set to the result of the operation or the
# *reason* will be set to the raised exception, as appropriate. All threads
# blocked on `#value` will return. Subsequent calls to `#value` will immediately
# return the cached value. The operation will only be run once. This means that
# any side effects created by the operation will only happen once as well.
#
# `Delay` includes the `Concurrent::Concern::Dereferenceable` mixin to support thread
# safety of the reference returned by `#value`.
#
# @note The default behavior of `Delay` is to block indefinitely when

# Old school kernel-style event reminiscent of Win32 programming in C++.
#
# When an `Event` is created it is in the `unset` state. Threads can choose to
# `#wait` on the event, blocking until released by another thread. When one
# thread wants to alert all blocking threads it calls the `#set` method which
# will then wake up all listeners. Once an `Event` has been set it remains set.
# New threads calling `#wait` will return immediately. An `Event` may be
# `#reset` at any time once it has been set.
#
# @example
#   event = Concurrent::Event.new
#
#   t1 = Thread.new do
#   puts "t1 is waiting"
#   event.wait(1)

# A synchronization point at which threads can pair and swap elements within
# pairs. Each thread presents some object on entry to the exchange method,
# matches with a partner thread, and receives its partner's object on return.
#
#
# ## Thread-safe Variable Classes
#
# Each of the thread-safe variable classes is designed to solve a different
# problem. In general:
#
# * *{Concurrent::Agent}:* Shared, mutable variable providing independent,
#   uncoordinated, *asynchronous* change of individual values. Best used when
#   the value will undergo frequent, complex updates. Suitable when the result
#   of an update does not need to be known immediately.
# * *{Concurrent::Atom}:* Shared, mutable variable providing independent,
#   uncoordinated, *synchronous* change of individual values. Best used when
#   the value will undergo frequent reads but only occasional, though complex,
#   updates. Suitable when the result of an update must be known immediately.
# * *{Concurrent::AtomicReference}:* A simple object reference that can be updated
#   atomically. Updates are synchronous but fast. Best used when updates a
#   simple set operations. Not suitable when updates are complex.
#   {Concurrent::AtomicBoolean} and {Concurrent::AtomicFixnum} are similar
#   but optimized for the given data type.
# * *{Concurrent::Exchanger}:* Shared, stateless synchronization point. Used
#   when two or more threads need to exchange data. The threads will pair then
#   block on each other until the exchange is complete.
# * *{Concurrent::MVar}:* Shared synchronization point. Used when one thread
#   must give a value to another, which must take the value. The threads will
#   block on each other until the exchange is complete.
# * *{Concurrent::ThreadLocalVar}:* Shared, mutable, isolated variable which
#   holds a different value for each thread which has access. Often used as
#   an instance variable in objects which must maintain different state
#   for different threads.
# * *{Concurrent::TVar}:* Shared, mutable variables which provide
#   *coordinated*, *synchronous*, change of *many* stated. Used when multiple
#   value must change together, in an all-or-nothing transaction.
# This implementation is very simple, using only a single slot for each
# exchanger (unlike more advanced implementations which use an "arena").
# This approach will work perfectly fine when there are only a few threads
# accessing a single `Exchanger`. Beyond a handful of threads the performance
# will degrade rapidly due to contention on the single slot, but the algorithm
# will remain correct.
#
# @example
#
#   exchanger = Concurrent::Exchanger.new
#
#   threads = [
#   Thread.new { puts "first: " << exchanger.exchange('foo', 1) }, #=> "first: bar"
#   Thread.new { puts "second: " << exchanger.exchange('bar', 1) } #=> "second: foo"
#   ]

# A `FiberLocalVar` is a variable where the value is different for each fiber.
# Each variable may have a default value, but when you modify the variable only
# the current fiber will ever see that change.
#
# This is similar to Ruby's built-in fiber-local variables (`Thread.current[:name]`),
# but with these major advantages:
# * `FiberLocalVar` has its own identity, it doesn't need a Symbol.
# * Each Ruby's built-in fiber-local variable leaks some memory forever (it's a Symbol held forever on the fiber),
#   so it's only OK to create a small amount of them.
#   `FiberLocalVar` has no such issue and it is fine to create many of them.
# * Ruby's built-in fiber-local variables leak forever the value set on each fiber (unless set to nil explicitly).
#   `FiberLocalVar` automatically removes the mapping for each fiber once the `FiberLocalVar` instance is GC'd.
#
# @example
#   v = FiberLocalVar.new(14)
#   v.value #=> 14
#   v.value = 2
#   v.value #=> 2
# @example
#   v = FiberLocalVar.new(14)

# A thread pool that reuses a fixed number of threads operating off an unbounded queue.
# At any point, at most `num_threads` will be active processing tasks. When all threads are busy new
# tasks `#post` to the thread pool are enqueued until a thread becomes available.
# Should a thread crash for any reason the thread will immediately be removed
# from the pool and replaced.
#
# The API and behavior of this class are based on Java's `FixedThreadPool`
#
# **Thread Pool Options**
#
# Thread pools support several configuration options:
#
# * `idletime`: The number of seconds that a thread may be idle before being reclaimed.
# * `name`: The name of the executor (optional). Printed in the executor's `#to_s` output and
#   a `<name>-worker-<id>` name is given to its threads if supported by used Ruby
#   implementation. `<id>` is uniq for each thread.
# * `max_queue`: The maximum number of tasks that may be waiting in the work queue at
#   any one time. When the queue size reaches `max_queue` and no new threads can be created,
#   subsequent tasks will be rejected in accordance with the configured `fallback_policy`.
# * `auto_terminate`: When true (default), the threads started will be marked as daemon.
# * `fallback_policy`: The policy defining how rejected tasks are handled.
#
# Three fallback policies are supported:
#
# * `:abort`: Raise a `RejectedExecutionError` exception and discard the task.
# * `:discard`: Discard the task and return false.
# * `:caller_runs`: Execute the task on the calling thread.
#
# **Shutting Down Thread Pools**
#
# Killing a thread pool while tasks are still being processed, either by calling
# the `#kill` method or at application exit, will have unpredictable results. There
# is no way for the thread pool to know what resources are being used by the
# in-progress tasks. When those tasks are killed the impact on those resources
# cannot be predicted. The *best* practice is to explicitly shutdown all thread
# pools using the provided methods:
#
# * Call `#shutdown` to initiate an orderly termination of all in-progress tasks
# * Call `#wait_for_termination` with an appropriate timeout interval an allow
#   the orderly shutdown to complete
# * Call `#kill` *only when* the thread pool fails to shutdown in the allotted time
#
# On some runtime platforms (most notably the JVM) the application will not
# exit until all thread pools have been shutdown. To prevent applications from
# "hanging" on exit, all threads can be marked as daemon according to the
# `:auto_terminate` option.
#
# ```ruby
# pool1 = Concurrent::FixedThreadPool.new(5) # threads will be marked as daemon
# pool2 = Concurrent::FixedThreadPool.new(5, auto_terminate: false) # mark threads as non-daemon
# ```
#
# @note Failure to properly shutdown a thread pool can lead to unpredictable results.

# An `IVar` is like a future that you can assign. As a future is a value that
# is being computed that you can wait on, an `IVar` is a value that is waiting
# to be assigned, that you can wait on. `IVars` are single assignment and
# deterministic.
#
# Then, express futures as an asynchronous computation that assigns an `IVar`.
# The `IVar` becomes the primitive on which [futures](Future) and
# [dataflow](Dataflow) are built.
#
# An `IVar` is a single-element container that is normally created empty, and
# can only be set once. The I in `IVar` stands for immutable. Reading an
# `IVar` normally blocks until it is set. It is safe to set and read an `IVar`
# from different threads.
#
# If you want to have some parallel task set the value in an `IVar`, you want
# a `Future`. If you want to create a graph of parallel tasks all executed
# when the values they depend on are ready you want `dataflow`. `IVar` is
# generally a low-level primitive.
#
# ## Examples
#
# Create, set and get an `IVar`
#
# ```ruby
# ivar = Concurrent::IVar.new
# ivar.set 14
# ivar.value #=> 14
# ivar.set 2 # would now be an error
# ```

# An `MVar` is a synchronized single element container. They are empty or
# contain one item. Taking a value from an empty `MVar` blocks, as does
# putting a value into a full one. You can either think of them as blocking
# queue of length one, or a special kind of mutable variable.
#
# On top of the fundamental `#put` and `#take` operations, we also provide a
# `#mutate` that is atomic with respect to operations on the same instance.
# These operations all support timeouts.
#
# We also support non-blocking operations `#try_put!` and `#try_take!`, a
# `#set!` that ignores existing values, a `#value` that returns the value
# without removing it or returns `MVar::EMPTY`, and a `#modify!` that yields
# `MVar::EMPTY` if the `MVar` is empty and can be used to set `MVar::EMPTY`.
# You shouldn't use these operations in the first instance.
#
# `MVar` is a [Dereferenceable](Dereferenceable).
#
# `MVar` is related to M-structures in Id, `MVar` in Haskell and `SyncVar` in Scala.
#
# Note that unlike the original Haskell paper, our `#take` is blocking. This is how
# Haskell and Scala do it today.

# A `Maybe` encapsulates an optional value. A `Maybe` either contains a value
# of (represented as `Just`), or it is empty (represented as `Nothing`). Using
# `Maybe` is a good way to deal with errors or exceptional cases without
# resorting to drastic measures such as exceptions.
#
# `Maybe` is a replacement for the use of `nil` with better type checking.
#
# For compatibility with {Concurrent::Concern::Obligation} the predicate and
# accessor methods are aliased as `fulfilled?`, `rejected?`, `value`, and
# `reason`.
#
# ## Motivation
#
# A common pattern in languages with pattern matching, such as Erlang and
# Haskell, is to return *either* a value *or* an error from a function
# Consider this Erlang code:
#
# ```erlang
# case file:consult("data.dat") of
#   {ok, Terms} -> do_something_useful(Terms);
#   {error, Reason} -> lager:error(Reason)
# end.
# ```
#
# In this example the standard library function `file:consult` returns a
# [tuple](http://erlang.org/doc/reference_manual/data_types.html#id69044)
# with two elements: an [atom](http://erlang.org/doc/reference_manual/data_types.html#id64134)
# (similar to a ruby symbol) and a variable containing ancillary data. On
# success it returns the atom `ok` and the data from the file. On failure it
# returns `error` and a string with an explanation of the problem. With this
# pattern there is no ambiguity regarding success or failure. If the file is
# empty the return value cannot be misinterpreted as an error. And when an
# error occurs the return value provides useful information.
#
# In Ruby we tend to return `nil` when an error occurs or else we raise an
# exception. Both of these idioms are problematic. Returning `nil` is
# ambiguous because `nil` may also be a valid value. It also lacks
# information pertaining to the nature of the error. Raising an exception
# is both expensive and usurps the normal flow of control. All of these
# problems can be solved with the use of a `Maybe`.
#
# A `Maybe` is unambiguous with regard to whether or not it contains a value.
# When `Just` it contains a value, when `Nothing` it does not. When `Just`
# the value it contains may be `nil`, which is perfectly valid. When
# `Nothing` the reason for the lack of a value is contained as well. The
# previous Erlang example can be duplicated in Ruby in a principled way by
# having functions return `Maybe` objects:
#
# ```ruby
# result = MyFileUtils.consult("data.dat") # returns a Maybe
# if result.just?
#   do_something_useful(result.value)      # or result.just
# else
#   logger.error(result.reason)            # or result.nothing
# end
# ```
#
# @example Returning a Maybe from a Function
#   module MyFileUtils
#   def self.consult(path)
#   file = File.open(path, 'r')
#   Concurrent::Maybe.just(file.read)
#   rescue => ex
#   return Concurrent::Maybe.nothing(ex)
#   ensure
#   file.close if file
#   end
#   end
#
#   maybe = MyFileUtils.consult('bogus.file')
#   maybe.just?    #=> false
#   maybe.nothing? #=> true
#   maybe.reason   #=> #<Errno::ENOENT: No such file or directory @ rb_sysopen - bogus.file>
#
#   maybe = MyFileUtils.consult('README.md')
#   maybe.just?    #=> true
#   maybe.nothing? #=> false
#   maybe.value    #=> "# Concurrent Ruby\n[![Gem Version..."
# @example Using Maybe with a Block
#   result = Concurrent::Maybe.from do
#   Client.find(10) # Client is an ActiveRecord model
#   end
#
#   # -- if the record was found
#   result.just? #=> true
#   result.value #=> #<Client id: 10, first_name: "Ryan">
#
#   # -- if the record was not found
#   result.just?  #=> false
#   result.reason #=> ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound
# @example Using Maybe with the Null Object Pattern
#   # In a Rails controller...
#   result = ClientService.new(10).find    # returns a Maybe
#   render json: result.or(NullClient.new)

# briefly but no explicit locking is required.
#
#
# ## Thread-safe Variable Classes
#
# Each of the thread-safe variable classes is designed to solve a different
# problem. In general:
#
# * *{Concurrent::Agent}:* Shared, mutable variable providing independent,
#   uncoordinated, *asynchronous* change of individual values. Best used when
#   the value will undergo frequent, complex updates. Suitable when the result
#   of an update does not need to be known immediately.
# * *{Concurrent::Atom}:* Shared, mutable variable providing independent,
#   uncoordinated, *synchronous* change of individual values. Best used when
#   the value will undergo frequent reads but only occasional, though complex,
#   updates. Suitable when the result of an update must be known immediately.
# * *{Concurrent::AtomicReference}:* A simple object reference that can be updated
#   atomically. Updates are synchronous but fast. Best used when updates a
#   simple set operations. Not suitable when updates are complex.
#   {Concurrent::AtomicBoolean} and {Concurrent::AtomicFixnum} are similar
#   but optimized for the given data type.
# * *{Concurrent::Exchanger}:* Shared, stateless synchronization point. Used
#   when two or more threads need to exchange data. The threads will pair then
#   block on each other until the exchange is complete.
# * *{Concurrent::MVar}:* Shared synchronization point. Used when one thread
#   must give a value to another, which must take the value. The threads will
#   block on each other until the exchange is complete.
# * *{Concurrent::ThreadLocalVar}:* Shared, mutable, isolated variable which
#   holds a different value for each thread which has access. Often used as
#   an instance variable in objects which must maintain different state
#   for different threads.
# * *{Concurrent::TVar}:* Shared, mutable variables which provide
#   *coordinated*, *synchronous*, change of *many* stated. Used when multiple
#   value must change together, in an all-or-nothing transaction.

# A numeric value that can be updated atomically. Reads and writes to an atomic
# fixnum and thread-safe and guaranteed to succeed. Reads and writes may block
# briefly but no explicit locking is required.
#
#
# ## Thread-safe Variable Classes
#
# Each of the thread-safe variable classes is designed to solve a different
# problem. In general:
#
# * *{Concurrent::Agent}:* Shared, mutable variable providing independent,
#   uncoordinated, *asynchronous* change of individual values. Best used when
#   the value will undergo frequent, complex updates. Suitable when the result
#   of an update does not need to be known immediately.
# * *{Concurrent::Atom}:* Shared, mutable variable providing independent,
#   uncoordinated, *synchronous* change of individual values. Best used when
#   the value will undergo frequent reads but only occasional, though complex,
#   updates. Suitable when the result of an update must be known immediately.
# * *{Concurrent::AtomicReference}:* A simple object reference that can be updated
#   atomically. Updates are synchronous but fast. Best used when updates a
#   simple set operations. Not suitable when updates are complex.
#   {Concurrent::AtomicBoolean} and {Concurrent::AtomicFixnum} are similar
#   but optimized for the given data type.
# * *{Concurrent::Exchanger}:* Shared, stateless synchronization point. Used
#   when two or more threads need to exchange data. The threads will pair then
#   block on each other until the exchange is complete.
# * *{Concurrent::MVar}:* Shared synchronization point. Used when one thread
#   must give a value to another, which must take the value. The threads will
#   block on each other until the exchange is complete.
# * *{Concurrent::ThreadLocalVar}:* Shared, mutable, isolated variable which
#   holds a different value for each thread which has access. Often used as
#   an instance variable in objects which must maintain different state
#   for different threads.
# * *{Concurrent::TVar}:* Shared, mutable variables which provide
#   *coordinated*, *synchronous*, change of *many* stated. Used when multiple
#   value must change together, in an all-or-nothing transaction.

# Promises are inspired by the JavaScript [Promises/A](http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Promises/A)
# and [Promises/A+](http://promises-aplus.github.io/promises-spec/) specifications.
#
# > A promise represents the eventual value returned from the single
# > completion of an operation.
#
# Promises are similar to futures and share many of the same behaviours.
# Promises are far more robust, however. Promises can be chained in a tree
# structure where each promise may have zero or more children. Promises are
# chained using the `then` method. The result of a call to `then` is always
# another promise. Promises are resolved asynchronously (with respect to the
# main thread) but in a strict order: parents are guaranteed to be resolved
# before their children, children before their younger siblings. The `then`
# method takes two parameters: an optional block to be executed upon parent
# resolution and an optional callable to be executed upon parent failure. The
# result of each promise is passed to each of its children upon resolution.
# When a promise is rejected all its children will be summarily rejected and
# will receive the reason.
#
# Promises have several possible states: *:unscheduled*, *:pending*,
# *:processing*, *:rejected*, or *:fulfilled*. These are also aggregated as
# `#incomplete?` and `#complete?`. When a Promise is created it is set to
# *:unscheduled*. Once the `#execute` method is called the state becomes
# *:pending*. Once a job is pulled from the thread pool's queue and is given
# to a thread for processing (often immediately upon `#post`) the state
# becomes *:processing*. The future will remain in this state until processing
# is complete. A future that is in the *:unscheduled*, *:pending*, or
# *:processing* is considered `#incomplete?`. A `#complete?` Promise is either
# *:rejected*, indicating that an exception was thrown during processing, or
# *:fulfilled*, indicating success. If a Promise is *:fulfilled* its `#value`
# will be updated to reflect the result of the operation. If *:rejected* the
# `reason` will be updated with a reference to the thrown exception. The
# predicate methods `#unscheduled?`, `#pending?`, `#rejected?`, and
# `#fulfilled?` can be called at any time to obtain the state of the Promise,
# as can the `#state` method, which returns a symbol.
#
# Retrieving the value of a promise is done through the `value` (alias:
# `deref`) method. Obtaining the value of a promise is a potentially blocking
# operation. When a promise is *rejected* a call to `value` will return `nil`
# immediately. When a promise is *fulfilled* a call to `value` will
# immediately return the current value. When a promise is *pending* a call to
# `value` will block until the promise is either *rejected* or *fulfilled*. A
# *timeout* value can be passed to `value` to limit how long the call will
# block. If `nil` the call will block indefinitely. If `0` the call will not
# block. Any other integer or float value will indicate the maximum number of
# seconds to block.
#
# Promises run on the global thread pool.
#
# ### Examples
#
# Start by requiring promises
#
# ```ruby
# require 'concurrent/promise'
# ```
#
# Then create one
#
# ```ruby
# p = Concurrent::Promise.execute do
#       # do something
#       42
#     end
# ```
#
# Promises can be chained using the `then` method. The `then` method accepts a
# block and an executor, to be executed on fulfillment, and a callable argument to be executed
# on rejection. The result of the each promise is passed as the block argument
# to chained promises.
#
# ```ruby
# p = Concurrent::Promise.new{10}.then{|x| x * 2}.then{|result| result - 10 }.execute
# ```
#
# And so on, and so on, and so on...
#
# ```ruby
# p = Concurrent::Promise.fulfill(20).
#     then{|result| result - 10 }.
#     then{|result| result * 3 }.
#     then(executor: different_executor){|result| result % 5 }.execute
# ```
#
# The initial state of a newly created Promise depends on the state of its parent:
# - if parent is *unscheduled* the child will be *unscheduled*
# - if parent is *pending* the child will be *pending*
# - if parent is *fulfilled* the child will be *pending*
# - if parent is *rejected* the child will be *pending* (but will ultimately be *rejected*)
#
# Promises are executed asynchronously from the main thread. By the time a
# child Promise finishes intialization it may be in a different state than its
# parent (by the time a child is created its parent may have completed
# execution and changed state). Despite being asynchronous, however, the order
# of execution of Promise objects in a chain (or tree) is strictly defined.
#
# There are multiple ways to create and execute a new `Promise`. Both ways
# provide identical behavior:
#
# ```ruby
# # create, operate, then execute
# p1 = Concurrent::Promise.new{ "Hello World!" }
# p1.state #=> :unscheduled
# p1.execute
#
# # create and immediately execute
# p2 = Concurrent::Promise.new{ "Hello World!" }.execute
#
# # execute during creation
# p3 = Concurrent::Promise.execute{ "Hello World!" }
# ```
#
# Once the `execute` method is called a `Promise` becomes `pending`:
#
# ```ruby
# p = Concurrent::Promise.execute{ "Hello, world!" }
# p.state    #=> :pending
# p.pending? #=> true
# ```
#
# Wait a little bit, and the promise will resolve and provide a value:
#
# ```ruby
# p = Concurrent::Promise.execute{ "Hello, world!" }
# sleep(0.1)
#
# p.state      #=> :fulfilled
# p.fulfilled? #=> true
# p.value      #=> "Hello, world!"
# ```
#
# If an exception occurs, the promise will be rejected and will provide
# a reason for the rejection:
#
# ```ruby
# p = Concurrent::Promise.execute{ raise StandardError.new("Here comes the Boom!") }
# sleep(0.1)
#
# p.state     #=> :rejected
# p.rejected? #=> true
# p.reason    #=> "#<StandardError: Here comes the Boom!>"
# ```
#
# #### Rejection
#
# When a promise is rejected all its children will be rejected and will
# receive the rejection `reason` as the rejection callable parameter:
#
# ```ruby
# p = Concurrent::Promise.execute { Thread.pass; raise StandardError }
#
# c1 = p.then(-> reason { 42 })
# c2 = p.then(-> reason { raise 'Boom!' })
#
# c1.wait.state  #=> :fulfilled
# c1.value       #=> 45
# c2.wait.state  #=> :rejected
# c2.reason      #=> #<RuntimeError: Boom!>
# ```
#
# Once a promise is rejected it will continue to accept children that will
# receive immediately rejection (they will be executed asynchronously).
#
# #### Aliases
#
# The `then` method is the most generic alias: it accepts a block to be
# executed upon parent fulfillment and a callable to be executed upon parent
# rejection. At least one of them should be passed. The default block is `{
# |result| result }` that fulfills the child with the parent value. The
# default callable is `{ |reason| raise reason }` that rejects the child with
# the parent reason.
#
# - `on_success { |result| ... }` is the same as `then {|result| ... }`
# - `rescue { |reason| ... }` is the same as `then(Proc.new { |reason| ... } )`
# - `rescue` is aliased by `catch` and `on_error`

# Ruby read-write lock implementation
#
# Allows any number of concurrent readers, but only one concurrent writer
# (And if the "write" lock is taken, any readers who come along will have to wait)
#
# If readers are already active when a writer comes along, the writer will wait for

# Any additional readers that come when the writer is already waiting, will also
# wait (so writers are not starved).

# Re-entrant read-write lock implementation
#
# Allows any number of concurrent readers, but only one concurrent writer
# (And while the "write" lock is taken, no read locks can be obtained either.
# Hence, the write lock can also be called an "exclusive" lock.)
#
# If another thread has taken a read lock, any thread which wants a write lock
# will block until all the readers release their locks. However, once a thread
# starts waiting to obtain a write lock, any additional readers that come along
# will also wait (so writers are not starved).
#
# A thread can acquire both a read and write lock at the same time. A thread can
# also acquire a read lock OR a write lock more than once. Only when the read (or
# write) lock is released as many times as it was acquired, will the thread
# actually let it go, allowing other threads which might have been waiting
# to proceed. Therefore the lock can be upgraded by first acquiring
# read lock and then write lock and that the lock can be downgraded by first
# having both read and write lock a releasing just the write lock.
#
# If both read and write locks are acquired by the same thread, it is not strictly
# necessary to release them in the same order they were acquired. In other words,
# the following code is legal:
#
# This implementation was inspired by `java.util.concurrent.ReentrantReadWriteLock`.
#
# @example
#   lock = Concurrent::ReentrantReadWriteLock.new
#   lock.acquire_write_lock
#   lock.acquire_read_lock
#   lock.release_write_lock
#   # At this point, the current thread is holding only a read lock, not a write
#   # lock. So other threads can take read locks, but not a write lock.
#   lock.release_read_lock
#   # Now the current thread is not holding either a read or write lock, so
#   # another thread could potentially acquire a write lock.
# @example
#   lock = Concurrent::ReentrantReadWriteLock.new
#   lock.with_read_lock  { data.retrieve }
#   lock.with_write_lock { data.modify! }

# **Thread Pool Options**
#
# Thread pools support several configuration options:
#
# * `idletime`: The number of seconds that a thread may be idle before being reclaimed.
# * `name`: The name of the executor (optional). Printed in the executor's `#to_s` output and
#   a `<name>-worker-<id>` name is given to its threads if supported by used Ruby
#   implementation. `<id>` is uniq for each thread.
# * `max_queue`: The maximum number of tasks that may be waiting in the work queue at
#   any one time. When the queue size reaches `max_queue` and no new threads can be created,
#   subsequent tasks will be rejected in accordance with the configured `fallback_policy`.
# * `auto_terminate`: When true (default), the threads started will be marked as daemon.
# * `fallback_policy`: The policy defining how rejected tasks are handled.
#
# Three fallback policies are supported:
#
# * `:abort`: Raise a `RejectedExecutionError` exception and discard the task.
# * `:discard`: Discard the task and return false.
# * `:caller_runs`: Execute the task on the calling thread.
#
# **Shutting Down Thread Pools**
#
# Killing a thread pool while tasks are still being processed, either by calling
# the `#kill` method or at application exit, will have unpredictable results. There
# is no way for the thread pool to know what resources are being used by the
# in-progress tasks. When those tasks are killed the impact on those resources
# cannot be predicted. The *best* practice is to explicitly shutdown all thread
# pools using the provided methods:
#
# * Call `#shutdown` to initiate an orderly termination of all in-progress tasks
# * Call `#wait_for_termination` with an appropriate timeout interval an allow
#   the orderly shutdown to complete
# * Call `#kill` *only when* the thread pool fails to shutdown in the allotted time
#
# On some runtime platforms (most notably the JVM) the application will not
# exit until all thread pools have been shutdown. To prevent applications from
# "hanging" on exit, all threads can be marked as daemon according to the
# `:auto_terminate` option.
#
# ```ruby
# pool1 = Concurrent::FixedThreadPool.new(5) # threads will be marked as daemon
# pool2 = Concurrent::FixedThreadPool.new(5, auto_terminate: false) # mark threads as non-daemon
# ```
#
# @note Failure to properly shutdown a thread pool can lead to unpredictable results.
#   Please read *Shutting Down Thread Pools* for more information.

# `ScheduledTask` is a close relative of `Concurrent::Future` but with one
# important difference: A `Future` is set to execute as soon as possible
# whereas a `ScheduledTask` is set to execute after a specified delay. This
# implementation is loosely based on Java's
# [ScheduledExecutorService](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/ScheduledExecutorService.html).
# It is a more feature-rich variant of {Concurrent.timer}.
#
# The *intended* schedule time of task execution is set on object construction
# with the `delay` argument. The delay is a numeric (floating point or integer)
# representing a number of seconds in the future. Any other value or a numeric
# equal to or less than zero will result in an exception. The *actual* schedule
# time of task execution is set when the `execute` method is called.
#
# The constructor can also be given zero or more processing options. Currently
# the only supported options are those recognized by the
# [Dereferenceable](Dereferenceable) module.
#
# The final constructor argument is a block representing the task to be performed.
# If no block is given an `ArgumentError` will be raised.
#
# **States**
#
# `ScheduledTask` mixes in the  [Obligation](Obligation) module thus giving it
# "future" behavior. This includes the expected lifecycle states. `ScheduledTask`
# has one additional state, however. While the task (block) is being executed the
# state of the object will be `:processing`. This additional state is necessary
# because it has implications for task cancellation.
#
# **Cancellation**
#
# A `:pending` task can be cancelled using the `#cancel` method. A task in any
# other state, including `:processing`, cannot be cancelled. The `#cancel`
# method returns a boolean indicating the success of the cancellation attempt.
# A cancelled `ScheduledTask` cannot be restarted. It is immutable.
#
# **Obligation and Observation**
#
# The result of a `ScheduledTask` can be obtained either synchronously or
# asynchronously. `ScheduledTask` mixes in both the [Obligation](Obligation)
# module and the
# [Observable](http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.0/libdoc/observer/rdoc/Observable.html)
# module from the Ruby standard library. With one exception `ScheduledTask`
# behaves identically to [Future](Observable) with regard to these modules.
#
# @example Basic usage

#   data = []
#   csv = URI.parse(uri).read
#   if csv.include?('call frequency')
#   return :rate_limit_exceeded
#   end
#   CSV.parse(csv, headers: true) do |row|
#   data << row['close'].to_f if row['timestamp'].include?(year.to_s)
#   end
#   year_end = data.first

# A counting semaphore. Conceptually, a semaphore maintains a set of

# releasing a blocking acquirer.
# However, no actual permit objects are used; the Semaphore just keeps a
# count of the number available and acts accordingly.
# Alternatively, permits may be acquired within a block, and automatically
# released after the block finishes executing.

# A thread pool with a single thread an unlimited queue. Should the thread

# A common pattern for background processing is to create a single thread
# on which an infinite loop is run. The thread's loop blocks on an input
# source (perhaps blocking I/O or a queue) and processes each input as it
# is received. This pattern has several issues. The thread itself is highly
# susceptible to errors during processing. Also, the thread itself must be
# constantly monitored and restarted should it die. `SingleThreadExecutor`
# encapsulates all these bahaviors. The task processor is highly resilient
# to errors from within tasks. Also, should the thread die it will
# automatically be restarted.

# A `TVar` is a transactional variable - a single-element container that
# is used as part of a transaction - see `Concurrent::atomically`.
#
#
# ## Thread-safe Variable Classes
#
# Each of the thread-safe variable classes is designed to solve a different
# problem. In general:
#
# * *{Concurrent::Agent}:* Shared, mutable variable providing independent,
#   uncoordinated, *asynchronous* change of individual values. Best used when
#   the value will undergo frequent, complex updates. Suitable when the result
#   of an update does not need to be known immediately.
# * *{Concurrent::Atom}:* Shared, mutable variable providing independent,
#   uncoordinated, *synchronous* change of individual values. Best used when
#   the value will undergo frequent reads but only occasional, though complex,
#   updates. Suitable when the result of an update must be known immediately.
# * *{Concurrent::AtomicReference}:* A simple object reference that can be updated
#   atomically. Updates are synchronous but fast. Best used when updates a
#   simple set operations. Not suitable when updates are complex.
#   {Concurrent::AtomicBoolean} and {Concurrent::AtomicFixnum} are similar
#   but optimized for the given data type.
# * *{Concurrent::Exchanger}:* Shared, stateless synchronization point. Used
#   when two or more threads need to exchange data. The threads will pair then
#   block on each other until the exchange is complete.
# * *{Concurrent::MVar}:* Shared synchronization point. Used when one thread
#   must give a value to another, which must take the value. The threads will
#   block on each other until the exchange is complete.
# * *{Concurrent::ThreadLocalVar}:* Shared, mutable, isolated variable which
#   holds a different value for each thread which has access. Often used as
#   an instance variable in objects which must maintain different state
#   for different threads.
# * *{Concurrent::TVar}:* Shared, mutable variables which provide
#   *coordinated*, *synchronous*, change of *many* stated. Used when multiple
#   value must change together, in an all-or-nothing transaction.

# A `ThreadLocalVar` is a variable where the value is different for each thread.
# Each variable may have a default value, but when you modify the variable only
# the current thread will ever see that change.
#
# This is similar to Ruby's built-in thread-local variables (`Thread#thread_variable_get`),
# but with these major advantages:
# * `ThreadLocalVar` has its own identity, it doesn't need a Symbol.
# * Each Ruby's built-in thread-local variable leaks some memory forever (it's a Symbol held forever on the thread),
#   so it's only OK to create a small amount of them.
#   `ThreadLocalVar` has no such issue and it is fine to create many of them.
# * Ruby's built-in thread-local variables leak forever the value set on each thread (unless set to nil explicitly).
#   `ThreadLocalVar` automatically removes the mapping for each thread once the `ThreadLocalVar` instance is GC'd.
#
#
# ## Thread-safe Variable Classes
#
# Each of the thread-safe variable classes is designed to solve a different
# problem. In general:
#
# * *{Concurrent::Agent}:* Shared, mutable variable providing independent,
#   uncoordinated, *asynchronous* change of individual values. Best used when
#   the value will undergo frequent, complex updates. Suitable when the result
#   of an update does not need to be known immediately.
# * *{Concurrent::Atom}:* Shared, mutable variable providing independent,
#   uncoordinated, *synchronous* change of individual values. Best used when
#   the value will undergo frequent reads but only occasional, though complex,
#   updates. Suitable when the result of an update must be known immediately.
# * *{Concurrent::AtomicReference}:* A simple object reference that can be updated
#   atomically. Updates are synchronous but fast. Best used when updates a
#   simple set operations. Not suitable when updates are complex.
#   {Concurrent::AtomicBoolean} and {Concurrent::AtomicFixnum} are similar
#   but optimized for the given data type.
# * *{Concurrent::Exchanger}:* Shared, stateless synchronization point. Used
#   when two or more threads need to exchange data. The threads will pair then
#   block on each other until the exchange is complete.
# * *{Concurrent::MVar}:* Shared synchronization point. Used when one thread
#   must give a value to another, which must take the value. The threads will
#   block on each other until the exchange is complete.
# * *{Concurrent::ThreadLocalVar}:* Shared, mutable, isolated variable which
#   holds a different value for each thread which has access. Often used as
#   an instance variable in objects which must maintain different state
#   for different threads.
# * *{Concurrent::TVar}:* Shared, mutable variables which provide
#   *coordinated*, *synchronous*, change of *many* stated. Used when multiple
#   value must change together, in an all-or-nothing transaction.

# running, a new thread will be created only if the queue is full.

# > Thread pools address two different problems: they usually provide
# > improved performance when executing large numbers of asynchronous tasks,
# > due to reduced per-task invocation overhead, and they provide a means
# > of bounding and managing the resources, including threads, consumed
# > when executing a collection of tasks. Each ThreadPoolExecutor also
# > maintains some basic statistics, such as the number of completed tasks.
# >
# > To be useful across a wide range of contexts, this class provides many
# > adjustable parameters and extensibility hooks. However, programmers are
# > urged to use the more convenient Executors factory methods
# > [CachedThreadPool] (unbounded thread pool, with automatic thread reclamation),
# > [FixedThreadPool] (fixed size thread pool) and [SingleThreadExecutor] (single
# > background thread), that preconfigure settings for the most common usage
# > scenarios.
#
# **Thread Pool Options**
#
# Thread pools support several configuration options:
#
# * `idletime`: The number of seconds that a thread may be idle before being reclaimed.
# * `name`: The name of the executor (optional). Printed in the executor's `#to_s` output and
#   a `<name>-worker-<id>` name is given to its threads if supported by used Ruby
#   implementation. `<id>` is uniq for each thread.
# * `max_queue`: The maximum number of tasks that may be waiting in the work queue at
#   any one time. When the queue size reaches `max_queue` and no new threads can be created,
#   subsequent tasks will be rejected in accordance with the configured `fallback_policy`.
# * `auto_terminate`: When true (default), the threads started will be marked as daemon.
# * `fallback_policy`: The policy defining how rejected tasks are handled.
#
# Three fallback policies are supported:
#
# * `:abort`: Raise a `RejectedExecutionError` exception and discard the task.
# * `:discard`: Discard the task and return false.
# * `:caller_runs`: Execute the task on the calling thread.
#
# **Shutting Down Thread Pools**
#
# Killing a thread pool while tasks are still being processed, either by calling
# the `#kill` method or at application exit, will have unpredictable results. There
# is no way for the thread pool to know what resources are being used by the
# in-progress tasks. When those tasks are killed the impact on those resources
# cannot be predicted. The *best* practice is to explicitly shutdown all thread
# pools using the provided methods:
#
# * Call `#shutdown` to initiate an orderly termination of all in-progress tasks
# * Call `#wait_for_termination` with an appropriate timeout interval an allow
#   the orderly shutdown to complete
# * Call `#kill` *only when* the thread pool fails to shutdown in the allotted time
#
# On some runtime platforms (most notably the JVM) the application will not
# exit until all thread pools have been shutdown. To prevent applications from
# "hanging" on exit, all threads can be marked as daemon according to the
# `:auto_terminate` option.
#
# ```ruby
# pool1 = Concurrent::FixedThreadPool.new(5) # threads will be marked as daemon
# pool2 = Concurrent::FixedThreadPool.new(5, auto_terminate: false) # mark threads as non-daemon
# ```
#
# @note Failure to properly shutdown a thread pool can lead to unpredictable results.
#   Please read *Shutting Down Thread Pools* for more information.

# A very common concurrency pattern is to run a thread that performs a task at
# regular intervals. The thread that performs the task sleeps for the given
# interval then wakes up and performs the task. Lather, rinse, repeat... This
# pattern causes two problems. First, it is difficult to test the business
# logic of the task because the task itself is tightly coupled with the
# concurrency logic. Second, an exception raised while performing the task can
# cause the entire thread to abend. In a long-running application where the
# task thread is intended to run for days/weeks/years a crashed task thread
# can pose a significant problem. `TimerTask` alleviates both problems.
#
# When a `TimerTask` is launched it starts a thread for monitoring the
# execution interval. The `TimerTask` thread does not perform the task,
# however. Instead, the TimerTask launches the task on a separate thread.
# Should the task experience an unrecoverable crash only the task thread will
# crash. This makes the `TimerTask` very fault tolerant. Additionally, the
# `TimerTask` thread can respond to the success or failure of the task,
# performing logging or ancillary operations.
#
# One other advantage of `TimerTask` is that it forces the business logic to
# be completely decoupled from the concurrency logic. The business logic can
# be tested separately then passed to the `TimerTask` for scheduling and
# running.
#
# A `TimerTask` supports two different types of interval calculations.
# A fixed delay will always wait the same amount of time between the
# completion of one task and the start of the next. A fixed rate will
# attempt to maintain a constant rate of execution regardless of the
# duration of the task. For example, if a fixed rate task is scheduled
# to run every 60 seconds but the task itself takes 10 seconds to
# complete, the next task will be scheduled to run 50 seconds after
# the start of the previous task. If the task takes 70 seconds to
# complete, the next task will be start immediately after the previous
# task completes. Tasks will not be executed concurrently.
#
# In some cases it may be necessary for a `TimerTask` to affect its own
# execution cycle. To facilitate this, a reference to the TimerTask instance
# is passed as an argument to the provided block every time the task is
# executed.
#
# The `TimerTask` class includes the `Dereferenceable` mixin module so the
# result of the last execution is always available via the `#value` method.
# Dereferencing options can be passed to the `TimerTask` during construction or
# at any later time using the `#set_deref_options` method.
#
# `TimerTask` supports notification through the Ruby standard library
# {http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.0/libdoc/observer/rdoc/Observable.html
# Observable} module. On execution the `TimerTask` will notify the observers
# with three arguments: time of execution, the result of the block (or nil on
# failure), and any raised exceptions (or nil on success).
#
# @example Basic usage
#   task = Concurrent::TimerTask.new{ puts 'Boom!' }
#   task.execute
#
#   task.execution_interval #=> 60 (default)
#
#   # wait 60 seconds...
#   #=> 'Boom!'
#
#   task.shutdown #=> true
# @example Configuring `:execution_interval`
#   task = Concurrent::TimerTask.new(execution_interval: 5) do
#   puts 'Boom!'
#   end
#
#   task.execution_interval #=> 5
# @example Immediate execution with `:run_now`
#   task = Concurrent::TimerTask.new(run_now: true){ puts 'Boom!' }
#   task.execute
#
#   #=> 'Boom!'
# @example Configuring `:interval_type` with either :fixed_delay or :fixed_rate, default is :fixed_delay
#   task = Concurrent::TimerTask.new(execution_interval: 5, interval_type: :fixed_rate) do
#   puts 'Boom!'
#   end
#   task.interval_type #=> :fixed_rate
# @example Last `#value` and `Dereferenceable` mixin
#   task = Concurrent::TimerTask.new(
#   dup_on_deref: true,
#   execution_interval: 5
#   ){ Time.now }
#
#   task.execute
#   Time.now   #=> 2013-11-07 18:06:50 -0500
#   sleep(10)
#   task.value #=> 2013-11-07 18:06:55 -0500
# @example Controlling execution from within the block
#   timer_task = Concurrent::TimerTask.new(execution_interval: 1) do |task|
#   task.execution_interval.to_i.times{ print 'Boom! ' }
#   print "\n"
#   task.execution_interval += 1
#   if task.execution_interval > 5
#   puts 'Stopping...'
#   task.shutdown
#   end
#   end
#
#   timer_task.execute
#   #=> Boom!
#   #=> Boom! Boom!
#   #=> Boom! Boom! Boom!
