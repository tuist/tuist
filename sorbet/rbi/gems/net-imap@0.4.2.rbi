# Net::IMAP implements Internet Message Access Protocol (\IMAP) client
# functionality.  The protocol is described
# in {IMAP4rev1 [RFC3501]}[https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3501]
# and {IMAP4rev2 [RFC9051]}[https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc9051].
#
# == \IMAP Overview
#
# An \IMAP client connects to a server, and then authenticates
# itself using either #authenticate or #login.  Having
# authenticated itself, there is a range of commands
# available to it.  Most work with mailboxes, which may be
# arranged in an hierarchical namespace, and each of which
# contains zero or more messages.  How this is implemented on
# the server is implementation-dependent; on a UNIX server, it
# will frequently be implemented as files in mailbox format
# within a hierarchy of directories.
#
# To work on the messages within a mailbox, the client must
# first select that mailbox, using either #select or #examine
# (for read-only access).  Once the client has successfully
# selected a mailbox, they enter the "_selected_" state, and that
# mailbox becomes the _current_ mailbox, on which mail-item
# related commands implicitly operate.
#
# === Sequence numbers and UIDs
#
# Messages have two sorts of identifiers: message sequence
# numbers and UIDs.
#
# Message sequence numbers number messages within a mailbox
# from 1 up to the number of items in the mailbox.  If a new
# message arrives during a session, it receives a sequence
# number equal to the new size of the mailbox.  If messages
# are expunged from the mailbox, remaining messages have their
# sequence numbers "shuffled down" to fill the gaps.
#
# To avoid sequence number race conditions, servers must not expunge messages
# when no command is in progress, nor when responding to #fetch, #store, or
# #search.  Expunges _may_ be sent during any other command, including
# #uid_fetch, #uid_store, and #uid_search.  The #noop and #idle commands are
# both useful for this side-effect: they allow the server to send all mailbox
# updates, including expunges.
#
# UIDs, on the other hand, are permanently guaranteed not to
# identify another message within the same mailbox, even if
# the existing message is deleted.  UIDs are required to
# be assigned in ascending (but not necessarily sequential)
# order within a mailbox; this means that if a non-IMAP client
# rearranges the order of mail items within a mailbox, the
# UIDs have to be reassigned.  An \IMAP client thus cannot
# rearrange message orders.
#
# === Examples of Usage
#
# ==== List sender and subject of all recent messages in the default mailbox
#
#   imap = Net::IMAP.new('mail.example.com')
#   imap.authenticate('PLAIN', 'joe_user', 'joes_password')
#   imap.examine('INBOX')
#   imap.search(["RECENT"]).each do |message_id|
#     envelope = imap.fetch(message_id, "ENVELOPE")[0].attr["ENVELOPE"]
#     puts "#{envelope.from[0].name}: \t#{envelope.subject}"
#   end
#
# ==== Move all messages from April 2003 from "Mail/sent-mail" to "Mail/sent-apr03"
#
#   imap = Net::IMAP.new('mail.example.com')
#   imap.authenticate('PLAIN', 'joe_user', 'joes_password')
#   imap.select('Mail/sent-mail')
#   if not imap.list('Mail/', 'sent-apr03')
#     imap.create('Mail/sent-apr03')
#   end
#   imap.search(["BEFORE", "30-Apr-2003", "SINCE", "1-Apr-2003"]).each do |message_id|
#     imap.copy(message_id, "Mail/sent-apr03")
#     imap.store(message_id, "+FLAGS", [:Deleted])
#   end
#   imap.expunge
#
# == Capabilities
#
# Most Net::IMAP methods do not _currently_ modify their behaviour according
# to the server's advertised #capabilities.  Users of this class must check
# that the server is capable of extension commands or command arguments before
# sending them.  Special care should be taken to follow the #capabilities
# requirements for #starttls, #login, and #authenticate.
#
# See #capable?, #auth_capable?, #capabilities, #auth_mechanisms to discover
# server capabilities.  For relevant capability requirements, see the
# documentation on each \IMAP command.
#
#   imap = Net::IMAP.new("mail.example.com")
#   imap.capable?(:IMAP4rev1) or raise "Not an IMAP4rev1 server"
#   imap.capable?(:starttls)  or raise "Cannot start TLS"
#   imap.starttls
#
#   if imap.auth_capable?("PLAIN")
#     imap.authenticate "PLAIN", username, password
#   elsif !imap.capability?("LOGINDISABLED")
#     imap.login username, password
#   else
#     raise "No acceptable authentication mechanisms"
#   end
#
#   # Support for "UTF8=ACCEPT" implies support for "ENABLE"
#   imap.enable :utf8 if imap.capable?("UTF8=ACCEPT")
#
#   namespaces  = imap.namespace if imap.capable?(:namespace)
#   mbox_prefix = namespaces&.personal&.first&.prefix || ""
#   mbox_delim  = namespaces&.personal&.first&.delim  || "/"
#   mbox_path   = prefix + %w[path to my mailbox].join(delim)
#   imap.create mbox_path
#
# === Basic IMAP4rev1 capabilities
#
# IMAP4rev1 servers must advertise +IMAP4rev1+ in their capabilities list.
# IMAP4rev1 servers must _implement_ the +STARTTLS+, <tt>AUTH=PLAIN</tt>,
# and +LOGINDISABLED+ capabilities.  See #starttls, #login, and #authenticate
# for the implications of these capabilities.
#
# === Caching +CAPABILITY+ responses
#
# Net::IMAP automatically stores and discards capability data according to the
# the requirements and recommendations in
# {IMAP4rev2 §6.1.1}[https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9051#section-6.1.1],
# {§6.2}[https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9051#section-6.2], and
# {§7.1}[https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9051#section-7.1].
# Use #capable?, #auth_capable?, or #capabilities to use this cache and avoid
# sending the #capability command unnecessarily.
#
# The server may advertise its initial capabilities using the +CAPABILITY+
# ResponseCode in a +PREAUTH+ or +OK+ #greeting.  When TLS has started
# (#starttls) and after authentication (#login or #authenticate), the server's
# capabilities may change and cached capabilities are discarded.  The server
# may send updated capabilities with an +OK+ TaggedResponse to #login or
# #authenticate, and these will be cached by Net::IMAP.  But the
# TaggedResponse to #starttls MUST be ignored--it is sent before TLS starts
# and is unprotected.
#
# When storing capability values to variables, be careful that they are
# discarded or reset appropriately, especially following #starttls.
#
# === Using IMAP4rev1 extensions
#
# See the {IANA IMAP4 capabilities
# registry}[http://www.iana.org/assignments/imap4-capabilities] for a list of
# all standard capabilities, and their reference RFCs.
#
# IMAP4rev1 servers must not activate behavior that is incompatible with the
# base specification until an explicit client action invokes a capability,
# e.g. sending a command or command argument specific to that capability.
# Servers may send data with backward compatible behavior, such as response
# codes or mailbox attributes, at any time without client action.
#
# Invoking capabilities which are unknown to Net::IMAP may cause unexpected
# behavior and errors.  For example, ResponseParseError is raised when
# unknown response syntax is received.  Invoking commands or command
# parameters that are unsupported by the server may raise NoResponseError,
# BadResponseError, or cause other unexpected behavior.
#
# Some capabilities must be explicitly activated using the #enable command.
# See #enable for details.
#
# == Thread Safety
#
# Net::IMAP supports concurrent threads. For example,
#
#   imap = Net::IMAP.new("imap.foo.net", "imap2")
#   imap.authenticate("scram-md5", "bar", "password")
#   imap.select("inbox")
#   fetch_thread = Thread.start { imap.fetch(1..-1, "UID") }
#   search_result = imap.search(["BODY", "hello"])
#   fetch_result = fetch_thread.value
#   imap.disconnect
#
# This script invokes the FETCH command and the SEARCH command concurrently.
#
# == Errors
#
# An \IMAP server can send three different types of responses to indicate
# failure:
#
# NO:: the attempted command could not be successfully completed.  For
#      instance, the username/password used for logging in are incorrect;
#      the selected mailbox does not exist; etc.
#
# BAD:: the request from the client does not follow the server's
#       understanding of the \IMAP protocol.  This includes attempting
#       commands from the wrong client state; for instance, attempting
#       to perform a SEARCH command without having SELECTed a current
#       mailbox.  It can also signal an internal server
#       failure (such as a disk crash) has occurred.
#
# BYE:: the server is saying goodbye.  This can be part of a normal
#       logout sequence, and can be used as part of a login sequence
#       to indicate that the server is (for some reason) unwilling
#       to accept your connection.  As a response to any other command,
#       it indicates either that the server is shutting down, or that
#       the server is timing out the client connection due to inactivity.
#
# These three error response are represented by the errors
# Net::IMAP::NoResponseError, Net::IMAP::BadResponseError, and
# Net::IMAP::ByeResponseError, all of which are subclasses of
# Net::IMAP::ResponseError.  Essentially, all methods that involve
# sending a request to the server can generate one of these errors.
# Only the most pertinent instances have been documented below.
#
# Because the IMAP class uses Sockets for communication, its methods
# are also susceptible to the various errors that can occur when
# working with sockets.  These are generally represented as
# Errno errors.  For instance, any method that involves sending a
# request to the server and/or receiving a response from it could
# raise an Errno::EPIPE error if the network connection unexpectedly
# goes down.  See the socket(7), ip(7), tcp(7), socket(2), connect(2),
# and associated man pages.
#
# Finally, a Net::IMAP::DataFormatError is thrown if low-level data
# is found to be in an incorrect format (for instance, when converting
# between UTF-8 and UTF-16), and Net::IMAP::ResponseParseError is
# thrown if a server response is non-parseable.

# === Connection control methods
#
# - Net::IMAP.new: Creates a new \IMAP client which connects immediately and
#   waits for a successful server greeting before the method returns.
# - #starttls: Asks the server to upgrade a clear-text connection to use TLS.
# - #logout: Tells the server to end the session. Enters the "_logout_" state.
# - #disconnect: Disconnects the connection (without sending #logout first).

#   SASL mechanism, for use with #authenticate.
# - #auth_mechanisms: Returns the #authenticate SASL mechanisms which
#   the server claims to support as an array of strings.
# - #clear_cached_capabilities: Clears cached capabilities.
#
#   <em>The capabilities cache is automatically cleared after completing
#   #starttls, #login, or #authenticate.</em>
# - #capability: Sends the +CAPABILITY+ command and returns the #capabilities.
#
#   <em>In general, #capable? should be used rather than explicitly sending a
#   +CAPABILITY+ command to the server.</em>

#   with every server response.
# - #response_handlers: Returns the list of response handlers.
# - #remove_response_handler: Remove a previously added response handler.
#
# === Core \IMAP commands
#
# The following commands are defined either by
# the [IMAP4rev1[https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3501]] base specification, or
# by one of the following extensions:
# [IDLE[https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2177]],
# [NAMESPACE[https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2342]],
# [UNSELECT[https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3691]],
# [ENABLE[https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5161]],
# [MOVE[https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6851]].
# These extensions are widely supported by modern IMAP4rev1 servers and have
# all been integrated into [IMAP4rev2[https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc9051]].
# <em>*NOTE:* Net::IMAP doesn't support IMAP4rev2 yet.</em>
#
# ==== Any state
#

#
#   <em>*Note:* Net::IMAP hasn't implemented <tt>LIST-EXTENDED</tt> yet.</em>
#
# ==== Selected state
#
# In addition to the commands for any state and the "_authenticated_"
# commands, the following commands are valid in the "_selected_" state:
#
# - #close: Closes the mailbox and returns to the "_authenticated_" state,
#   expunging deleted messages, unless the mailbox was opened as read-only.
# - #unselect: Closes the mailbox and returns to the "_authenticated_" state,

# - #check: <em>*Obsolete:* removed from +IMAP4rev2+.</em>
#   Can be replaced with #noop or #idle.
#
# ==== Logout state
#
# No \IMAP commands are valid in the "_logout_" state.  If the socket is still
# open, Net::IMAP will close it after receiving server confirmation.
# Exceptions will be raised by \IMAP commands that have already started and
# are waiting for a response, as well as any that are called after logout.

  # Creates a new Net::IMAP object and connects it to the specified
  # +host+.
  #
  # ==== Options
  #
  # Accepts the following options:
  #
  # [port]
  #   Port number.  Defaults to 993 when +ssl+ is truthy, and 143 otherwise.
  #
  # [ssl]
  #   If +true+, the connection will use TLS with the default params set by
  #   {OpenSSL::SSL::SSLContext#set_params}[https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/OpenSSL/SSL/SSLContext.html#method-i-set_params].
  #   If +ssl+ is a hash, it's passed to
  #   {OpenSSL::SSL::SSLContext#set_params}[https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/OpenSSL/SSL/SSLContext.html#method-i-set_params];
  #   the keys are names of attribute assignment methods on
  #   SSLContext[https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/OpenSSL/SSL/SSLContext.html].
  #
  # [open_timeout]
  #   Seconds to wait until a connection is opened
  # [idle_response_timeout]
  #   Seconds to wait until an IDLE response is received
  #
  # See DeprecatedClientOptions.new for deprecated arguments.
  #
  # ==== Examples
  #
  # Connect to cleartext port 143 at mail.example.com and recieve the server greeting:
  #   imap = Net::IMAP.new('mail.example.com', ssl: false) # => #<Net::IMAP:0x00007f79b0872bd0>
  #   imap.port          => 143
  #   imap.tls_verified? => false
  #   imap.greeting      => name: ("OK" | "PREAUTH") => status
  #   status # => "OK"
  #   # The client is connected in the "Not Authenticated" state.
  #
  # Connect with TLS to port 993
  #   imap = Net::IMAP.new('mail.example.com', ssl: true) # => #<Net::IMAP:0x00007f79b0872bd0>
  #   imap.port          => 993
  #   imap.tls_verified? => true
  #   imap.greeting      => name: (/OK/i | /PREAUTH/i) => status
  #   case status
  #   in /OK/i
  #     # The client is connected in the "Not Authenticated" state.
  #     imap.authenticate("PLAIN", "joe_user", "joes_password")
  #   in /PREAUTH/i
  #     # The client is connected in the "Authenticated" state.
  #   end
  #
  # Connect with prior authentication, for example using an SSL certificate:
  #   ssl_ctx_params = {
  #     cert: OpenSSL::X509::Certificate.new(File.read("client.crt")),
  #     key:  OpenSSL::PKey::EC.new(File.read('client.key')),
  #     extra_chain_cert: [
  #       OpenSSL::X509::Certificate.new(File.read("intermediate.crt")),
  #     ],
  #   }
  #   imap = Net::IMAP.new('mail.example.com', ssl: ssl_ctx_params)
  #   imap.port          => 993
  #   imap.tls_verified? => true
  #   imap.greeting      => name: "PREAUTH"
  #   # The client is connected in the "Authenticated" state.
  #
  # ==== Exceptions
  #
  # The most common errors are:
  #
  # [Errno::ECONNREFUSED]
  #   Connection refused by +host+ or an intervening firewall.
  # [Errno::ETIMEDOUT]
  #   Connection timed out (possibly due to packets being dropped by an
  #   intervening firewall).
  # [Errno::ENETUNREACH]
  #   There is no route to that network.
  # [SocketError]
  #   Hostname not known or other socket error.
  # [Net::IMAP::ByeResponseError]
  #   Connected to the host successfully, but it immediately said goodbye.

  #
  # For example:

  #
  # ==== Mechanisms
  #
  # Each mechanism has different properties and requirements.  Please consult
  # the documentation for the specific mechanisms you are using:
  #
  # +ANONYMOUS+::
  #     See AnonymousAuthenticator[rdoc-ref:Net::IMAP::SASL::AnonymousAuthenticator].
  #
  #     Allows the user to gain access to public services or resources without
  #     authenticating or disclosing an identity.
  #
  # +EXTERNAL+::
  #     See ExternalAuthenticator[rdoc-ref:Net::IMAP::SASL::ExternalAuthenticator].
  #
  #     Authenticates using already established credentials, such as a TLS
  #     certificate or IPsec.
  #
  # +OAUTHBEARER+::
  #     See OAuthBearerAuthenticator[rdoc-ref:Net::IMAP::SASL::OAuthBearerAuthenticator].
  #
  #     Login using an OAuth2 Bearer token.  This is the standard mechanism
  #     for using OAuth2 with \SASL, but it is not yet deployed as widely as
  #     +XOAUTH2+.
  #
  # +PLAIN+::
  #     See PlainAuthenticator[rdoc-ref:Net::IMAP::SASL::PlainAuthenticator].
  #
  #     Login using clear-text username and password.
  #
  # +SCRAM-SHA-1+::
  # +SCRAM-SHA-256+::
  #     See ScramAuthenticator[rdoc-ref:Net::IMAP::SASL::ScramAuthenticator].
  #
  #     Login by username and password.  The password is not sent to the
  #     server but is used in a salted challenge/response exchange.
  #     +SCRAM-SHA-1+ and +SCRAM-SHA-256+ are directly supported by
  #     Net::IMAP::SASL.  New authenticators can easily be added for any other
  #     <tt>SCRAM-*</tt> mechanism if the digest algorithm is supported by
  #     OpenSSL::Digest.
  #
  # +XOAUTH2+::
  #     See XOAuth2Authenticator[rdoc-ref:Net::IMAP::SASL::XOAuth2Authenticator].
  #
  #     Login using a username and an OAuth2 access token.  Non-standard and
  #     obsoleted by +OAUTHBEARER+, but widely supported.
  #
  # See the {SASL mechanism
  # registry}[https://www.iana.org/assignments/sasl-mechanisms/sasl-mechanisms.xhtml]
  # for a list of all SASL mechanisms and their specifications.  To register
  # new authenticators, see Authenticators.
  #
  # ===== Deprecated mechanisms
  #
  # <em>Obsolete mechanisms should be avoided, but are still available for
  # backwards compatibility.  See</em> Net::IMAP::SASL@Deprecated+mechanisms.
  # <em>Using a deprecated mechanism will print a warning.</em>
  #
  # ==== Capabilities
  #
  # <tt>"AUTH=#{mechanism}"</tt> capabilities indicate server support for
  # mechanisms.  Use #auth_capable? or #auth_mechanisms to check for support
  # before using a particular mechanism.
  #
  #    if imap.auth_capable? "XOAUTH2"
  #      imap.authenticate "XOAUTH2", username, oauth2_access_token
  #    elsif imap.auth_capable? "PLAIN"
  #      imap.authenticate "PLAIN", username, password
  #    elsif !imap.capability? "LOGINDISABLED"
  #      imap.login username, password
  #    else
  #      raise "No acceptable authentication mechanism is available"
  #    end
  #
  # Although servers should list all supported \SASL mechanisms, they may
  # allow authentication with an unlisted +mechanism+.
  #
  # If [SASL-IR[https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4959.html]] is supported
  # and the appropriate <tt>"AUTH=#{mechanism}"</tt> capability is present,
  # an "initial response" may be sent as an argument to the +AUTHENTICATE+
  # command, saving a round-trip.  The SASL exchange allows for server
  # challenges and client responses, but many mechanisms expect the client to
  # "respond" first.  The initial response will only be sent for
  # "client-first" mechanisms.
  #
  # Server capabilities may change after #starttls, #login, and #authenticate.
  # Previously cached #capabilities will be cleared when this method
  # completes.  If the TaggedResponse to #authenticate includes updated
  # capabilities, they will be cached.

  #
  # Related: #capable?, #capabilities, #capability
  #
  # ===== Capabilities
  #
  # The server's capabilities must include
  # +ENABLE+ [RFC5161[https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5161]]
  # or +IMAP4REV2+ [RFC9051[https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc9051]].
  #
  # Additionally, the server capabilities must include a capability matching
  # each enabled extension (usually the same name as the enabled extension).
  # The following capabilities may be enabled:
  #
  # [+:utf8+ --- an alias for <tt>"UTF8=ACCEPT"</tt>]
  #
  #   In a future release, <tt>enable(:utf8)</tt> will enable either
  #   <tt>"UTF8=ACCEPT"</tt> or <tt>"IMAP4rev2"</tt>, depending on server
  #   capabilities.
  #
  # [<tt>"UTF8=ACCEPT"</tt> [RFC6855[https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6855]]]
  #
  #   The server's capabilities must include <tt>UTF8=ACCEPT</tt> _or_
  #   <tt>UTF8=ONLY</tt>.
  #
  #   This allows the server to send strings encoded as UTF-8 which might
  #   otherwise need to use a 7-bit encoding, such as {modified
  #   UTF-7}[::decode_utf7] for mailbox names, or RFC2047 encoded-words for
  #   message headers.
  #
  #   *Note:* <em>A future update may set string encodings slightly
  #   differently</em>, e.g: "US-ASCII" when UTF-8 is not enabled, and "UTF-8"
  #   when it is.  Currently, the encoding of strings sent as "quoted" or
  #   "text" will _always_ be "UTF-8", even when only ASCII characters are
  #   used (e.g. "Subject: Agenda") And currently, string "literals" sent
  #   by the server will always have an "ASCII-8BIT" (binary)
  #   encoding, even if they generally contain UTF-8 data, if they are
  #   text at all.
  #
  # [<tt>"UTF8=ONLY"</tt> [RFC6855[https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6855]]]
  #
  #   A server that reports the <tt>UTF8=ONLY</tt> capability _requires_ that
  #   the client <tt>enable("UTF8=ACCEPT")</tt> before any mailboxes may be
  #   selected.  For convenience, <tt>enable("UTF8=ONLY")</tt> is aliased to
  #   <tt>enable("UTF8=ACCEPT")</tt>.
  #
  # ===== Unsupported capabilities
  #
  # *Note:* Some extensions that use ENABLE permit the server to send syntax
  # that Net::IMAP cannot parse, which may raise an exception and disconnect.
  # Some extensions may work, but the support may be incomplete, untested, or
  # experimental.
  #
  # Until a capability is documented here as supported, enabling it may result
  # in undocumented behavior and a future release may update with incompatible
  # behavior <em>without warning or deprecation</em>.

# BodyTypeText:: Used by <tt>text/*</tt> parts.  Contains all of the
#                BodyTypeBasic fields.
# BodyTypeMessage:: Used by <tt>message/rfc822</tt> and
#                   <tt>message/global</tt> parts.  Contains all of the
#                   BodyTypeBasic fields.  Other <tt>message/*</tt> types
#                   should use BodyTypeBasic.
# BodyTypeMultipart:: for <tt>multipart/*</tt> parts
#
# source://net-imap//lib/net/imap/response_data.rb#894
module Net::IMAP::BodyStructure; end

# BodyTypeAttachment is not used and will be removed in an upcoming release.
#
# === Bug Analysis
#
# \IMAP body structures are parenthesized lists and assign their fields
# positionally, so missing fields change the intepretation of all
# following fields.  Additionally, different body types have a different
# number of required fields, followed by optional "extension" fields.
#
# BodyTypeAttachment was previously returned when a "message/rfc822" part,
# which should be sent as <tt>body-type-msg</tt> with ten required fields,
# was actually sent as a <tt>body-type-basic</tt> with _seven_ required
# fields.
#
#   basic => type, subtype, param, id, desc, enc, octets, md5=nil,  dsp=nil, lang=nil, loc=nil, *ext
#   msg   => type, subtype, param, id, desc, enc, octets, envelope, body,    lines,    md5=nil, ...
#
# Normally, +envelope+ and +md5+ are incompatible, but Net::IMAP leniently
# allowed buggy servers to send +NIL+ for +envelope+.  As a result, when a
# server sent a <tt>message/rfc822</tt> part with +NIL+ for +md5+ and a
# non-<tt>NIL</tt> +dsp+, Net::IMAP mis-interpreted the
# <tt>Content-Disposition</tt> as if it were a strange body type.  In all
# reported cases, the <tt>Content-Disposition</tt> was "attachment", so
# BodyTypeAttachment was created as the workaround.
#
# === Current behavior
#
# When interpreted strictly, +envelope+ and +md5+ are incompatible.  So the
# current parsing algorithm peeks ahead after it has recieved the seventh
# body field.  If the next token is not the start of an +envelope+, we assume
# the server has incorrectly sent us a <tt>body-type-basic</tt> and return
# BodyTypeBasic.  As a result, what was previously BodyTypeMessage#body =>
# BodyTypeAttachment is now BodyTypeBasic#disposition => ContentDisposition.

# common \SASL framework:
# >>>
#   SASL is conceptually a framework that provides an abstraction layer
#   between protocols and mechanisms as illustrated in the following
#   diagram.
#
#               SMTP    LDAP    XMPP   Other protocols ...
#                  \       |    |      /
#                   \      |    |     /
#                  SASL abstraction layer
#                   /      |    |     \
#                  /       |    |      \
#           EXTERNAL   GSSAPI  PLAIN   Other mechanisms ...
#
# Net::IMAP uses SASL via the Net::IMAP#authenticate method.
#
# == Mechanisms
#
# Each mechanism has different properties and requirements.  Please consult
# the documentation for the specific mechanisms you are using:
#
# +ANONYMOUS+::
#     See AnonymousAuthenticator.
#
#     Allows the user to gain access to public services or resources without
#     authenticating or disclosing an identity.
#
# +EXTERNAL+::
#     See ExternalAuthenticator.
#
#     Authenticates using already established credentials, such as a TLS
#     certificate or IPsec.
#
# +OAUTHBEARER+::
#     See OAuthBearerAuthenticator.
#
#     Login using an OAuth2 Bearer token.  This is the standard mechanism
#     for using OAuth2 with \SASL, but it is not yet deployed as widely as
#     +XOAUTH2+.
#
# +PLAIN+::
#     See PlainAuthenticator.
#
#     Login using clear-text username and password.
#
# +SCRAM-SHA-1+::
# +SCRAM-SHA-256+::
#     See ScramAuthenticator.
#
#     Login by username and password.  The password is not sent to the
#     server but is used in a salted challenge/response exchange.
#     +SCRAM-SHA-1+ and +SCRAM-SHA-256+ are directly supported by
#     Net::IMAP::SASL.  New authenticators can easily be added for any other
#     <tt>SCRAM-*</tt> mechanism if the digest algorithm is supported by
#     OpenSSL::Digest.
#
# +XOAUTH2+::
#     See XOAuth2Authenticator.
#
#     Login using a username and an OAuth2 access token.  Non-standard and
#     obsoleted by +OAUTHBEARER+, but widely supported.
#
# See the {SASL mechanism
# registry}[https://www.iana.org/assignments/sasl-mechanisms/sasl-mechanisms.xhtml]
# for a list of all SASL mechanisms and their specifications.  To register
# new authenticators, see Authenticators.
#
# === Deprecated mechanisms
#
# <em>Obsolete mechanisms should be avoided, but are still available for
# backwards compatibility.</em>
#
# >>>
#   For +DIGEST-MD5+ see DigestMD5Authenticator.
#
#   For +LOGIN+, see LoginAuthenticator.

# Abstract base class for the "+SCRAM-*+" family of SASL mechanisms,
# defined in RFC5802[https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5802].  Use via
# Net::IMAP#authenticate.
#
# Directly supported:
# * +SCRAM-SHA-1+   --- ScramSHA1Authenticator
# * +SCRAM-SHA-256+ --- ScramSHA256Authenticator
#
# New +SCRAM-*+ mechanisms can easily be added for any hash algorithm
# supported by
# OpenSSL::Digest[https://ruby.github.io/openssl/OpenSSL/Digest.html].
# Subclasses need only set an appropriate +DIGEST_NAME+ constant.
#
# === SCRAM algorithm
#
# See the documentation and method definitions on ScramAlgorithm for an
# overview of the algorithm.  The different mechanisms differ only by
# which hash function that is used (or by support for channel binding with
# +-PLUS+).
#
# See also the methods on GS2Header.
#
# ==== Server messages
#
# As server messages are received, they are validated and loaded into
# the various attributes, e.g: #snonce, #salt, #iterations, #verifier,
# #server_error, etc.
#
# Unlike many other SASL mechanisms, the +SCRAM-*+ family supports mutual
# authentication and can return server error data in the server messages.
# If #process raises an Error for the server-final-message, then
# server_error may contain error details.
#
# === TLS Channel binding
#
# <em>The <tt>SCRAM-*-PLUS</tt> mechanisms and channel binding are not
# supported yet.</em>
#
# === Caching SCRAM secrets
#
# <em>Caching of salted_password, client_key, stored_key, and server_key
# is not supported yet.</em>
