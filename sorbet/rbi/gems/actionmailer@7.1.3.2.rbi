# = Action Mailer \Base
#
# Action Mailer allows you to send email from your application using a mailer model and views.
#
# == Mailer Models
#
# To use Action Mailer, you need to create a mailer model.
#
#   $ bin/rails generate mailer Notifier
#
# The generated model inherits from <tt>ApplicationMailer</tt> which in turn
# inherits from +ActionMailer::Base+. A mailer model defines methods
# used to generate an email message. In these methods, you can set up variables to be used in
# the mailer views, options on the mail itself such as the <tt>:from</tt> address, and attachments.
#
#   class ApplicationMailer < ActionMailer::Base
#     default from: 'from@example.com'
#     layout 'mailer'
#   end
#
#   class NotifierMailer < ApplicationMailer
#     default from: 'no-reply@example.com',
#             return_path: 'system@example.com'
#
#     def welcome(recipient)
#       @account = recipient
#       mail(to: recipient.email_address_with_name,
#            bcc: ["bcc@example.com", "Order Watcher <watcher@example.com>"])
#     end
#   end
#
# Within the mailer method, you have access to the following methods:
#
# * <tt>attachments[]=</tt> - Allows you to add attachments to your email in an intuitive
#   manner; <tt>attachments['filename.png'] = File.read('path/to/filename.png')</tt>
#
# * <tt>attachments.inline[]=</tt> - Allows you to add an inline attachment to your email
#   in the same manner as <tt>attachments[]=</tt>
#
# * <tt>headers[]=</tt> - Allows you to specify any header field in your email such
#   as <tt>headers['X-No-Spam'] = 'True'</tt>. Note that declaring a header multiple times
#   will add many fields of the same name. Read #headers doc for more information.
#
# * <tt>headers(hash)</tt> - Allows you to specify multiple headers in your email such
#   as <tt>headers({'X-No-Spam' => 'True', 'In-Reply-To' => '1234@message.id'})</tt>
#
# * <tt>mail</tt> - Allows you to specify email to be sent.
#
# The hash passed to the mail method allows you to specify any header that a +Mail::Message+
# will accept (any valid email header including optional fields).
#
# The +mail+ method, if not passed a block, will inspect your views and send all the views with
# the same name as the method, so the above action would send the +welcome.text.erb+ view
# file as well as the +welcome.html.erb+ view file in a +multipart/alternative+ email.
#
# If you want to explicitly render only certain templates, pass a block:
#
#   mail(to: user.email) do |format|
#     format.text
#     format.html
#   end
#
# The block syntax is also useful in providing information specific to a part:
#
#   mail(to: user.email) do |format|
#     format.html
#   end
#
# Or even to render a special view:
#
#   mail(to: user.email) do |format|
#     format.text
#     format.html { render "some_other_template" }
#   end
#
# == Mailer views
#
# Like Action Controller, each mailer class has a corresponding view directory in which each
# method of the class looks for a template with its name.
#
# To define a template to be used with a mailer, create an <tt>.erb</tt> file with the same
# name as the method in your mailer model. For example, in the mailer defined above, the template at
# <tt>app/views/notifier_mailer/welcome.text.erb</tt> would be used to generate the email.
#
# Variables defined in the methods of your mailer model are accessible as instance variables in their
# corresponding view.
#
# Emails by default are sent in plain text, so a sample view for our model example might look like this:
#
#   Hi <%= @account.name %>,
#   Thanks for joining our service! Please check back often.
#
# You can even use Action View helpers in these views. For example:
#
#   You got a new note!
#   <%= truncate(@note.body, length: 25) %>
#
# If you need to access the subject, from, or the recipients in the view, you can do that through message object:
#
#   You got a new note from <%= message.from %>!
#   <%= truncate(@note.body, length: 25) %>
#
#
# == Generating URLs
#
# URLs can be generated in mailer views using <tt>url_for</tt> or named routes. Unlike controllers from
# Action Pack, the mailer instance doesn't have any context about the incoming request, so you'll need
# to provide all of the details needed to generate a URL.
#
# When using <tt>url_for</tt> you'll need to provide the <tt>:host</tt>, <tt>:controller</tt>, and <tt>:action</tt>:
#
#   <%= url_for(host: "example.com", controller: "welcome", action: "greeting") %>
#
# When using named routes you only need to supply the <tt>:host</tt>:
#
#   <%= users_url(host: "example.com") %>
#
# You should use the <tt>named_route_url</tt> style (which generates absolute URLs) and avoid using the
# <tt>named_route_path</tt> style (which generates relative URLs), since clients reading the mail will
# have no concept of a current URL from which to determine a relative path.
#
# It is also possible to set a default host that will be used in all mailers by setting the <tt>:host</tt>
# option as a configuration option in <tt>config/application.rb</tt>:
#
#   config.action_mailer.default_url_options = { host: "example.com" }
#
# You can also define a <tt>default_url_options</tt> method on individual mailers to override these
# default settings per-mailer.
#
# By default when <tt>config.force_ssl</tt> is +true+, URLs generated for hosts will use the HTTPS protocol.
#
# == Sending mail
#
# Once a mailer action and template are defined, you can deliver your message or defer its creation and
# delivery for later:
#
#   NotifierMailer.welcome(User.first).deliver_now # sends the email
#   mail = NotifierMailer.welcome(User.first)      # => an ActionMailer::MessageDelivery object
#   mail.deliver_now                               # generates and sends the email now
#
# The ActionMailer::MessageDelivery class is a wrapper around a delegate that will call
# your method to generate the mail. If you want direct access to the delegator, or +Mail::Message+,
# you can call the <tt>message</tt> method on the ActionMailer::MessageDelivery object.
#
#   NotifierMailer.welcome(User.first).message     # => a Mail::Message object
#
# Action Mailer is nicely integrated with Active Job so you can generate and send emails in the background
# (example: outside of the request-response cycle, so the user doesn't have to wait on it):
#
#   NotifierMailer.welcome(User.first).deliver_later # enqueue the email sending to Active Job
#
# Note that <tt>deliver_later</tt> will execute your method from the background job.
#
# You never instantiate your mailer class. Rather, you just call the method you defined on the class itself.
# All instance methods are expected to return a message object to be sent.
#
# == Multipart Emails
#
# Multipart messages can also be used implicitly because Action Mailer will automatically detect and use
# multipart templates, where each template is named after the name of the action, followed by the content
# type. Each such detected template will be added to the message, as a separate part.
#
# For example, if the following templates exist:
# * signup_notification.text.erb
# * signup_notification.html.erb
# * signup_notification.xml.builder
# * signup_notification.yml.erb
#
# Each would be rendered and added as a separate part to the message, with the corresponding content
# type. The content type for the entire message is automatically set to <tt>multipart/alternative</tt>,
# which indicates that the email contains multiple different representations of the same email
# body. The same instance variables defined in the action are passed to all email templates.
#
# Implicit template rendering is not performed if any attachments or parts have been added to the email.
# This means that you'll have to manually add each part to the email and set the content type of the email
# to <tt>multipart/alternative</tt>.
#
# == Attachments
#
# Sending attachment in emails is easy:
#
#   class NotifierMailer < ApplicationMailer
#     def welcome(recipient)
#       attachments['free_book.pdf'] = File.read('path/to/file.pdf')
#       mail(to: recipient, subject: "New account information")
#     end
#   end
#
# Which will (if it had both a <tt>welcome.text.erb</tt> and <tt>welcome.html.erb</tt>
# template in the view directory), send a complete <tt>multipart/mixed</tt> email with two parts,
# the first part being a <tt>multipart/alternative</tt> with the text and HTML email parts inside,
# and the second being a <tt>application/pdf</tt> with a Base64 encoded copy of the file.pdf book
# with the filename +free_book.pdf+.
#
# If you need to send attachments with no content, you need to create an empty view for it,
# or add an empty body parameter like this:
#
#     class NotifierMailer < ApplicationMailer
#       def welcome(recipient)
#         attachments['free_book.pdf'] = File.read('path/to/file.pdf')
#         mail(to: recipient, subject: "New account information", body: "")
#       end
#     end
#
# You can also send attachments with HTML template, in this case you need to add body, attachments,
# and custom content type like this:
#
#     class NotifierMailer < ApplicationMailer
#       def welcome(recipient)
#         attachments["free_book.pdf"] = File.read("path/to/file.pdf")
#         mail(to: recipient,
#              subject: "New account information",
#              content_type: "text/html",
#              body: "<html><body>Hello there</body></html>")
#       end
#     end
#
# == Inline Attachments
#
# You can also specify that a file should be displayed inline with other HTML. This is useful
# if you want to display a corporate logo or a photo.
#
#   class NotifierMailer < ApplicationMailer
#     def welcome(recipient)
#       attachments.inline['photo.png'] = File.read('path/to/photo.png')
#       mail(to: recipient, subject: "Here is what we look like")
#     end
#   end
#
# And then to reference the image in the view, you create a <tt>welcome.html.erb</tt> file and
# make a call to +image_tag+ passing in the attachment you want to display and then call
# +url+ on the attachment to get the relative content id path for the image source:
#
#   <h1>Please Don't Cringe</h1>
#
#   <%= image_tag attachments['photo.png'].url -%>
#
# As we are using Action View's +image_tag+ method, you can pass in any other options you want:
#
#   <h1>Please Don't Cringe</h1>
#
#   <%= image_tag attachments['photo.png'].url, alt: 'Our Photo', class: 'photo' -%>
#
# == Observing and Intercepting Mails
#
# Action Mailer provides hooks into the Mail observer and interceptor methods. These allow you to
# register classes that are called during the mail delivery life cycle.
#
# An observer class must implement the <tt>:delivered_email(message)</tt> method which will be
# called once for every email sent after the email has been sent.
#
# An interceptor class must implement the <tt>:delivering_email(message)</tt> method which will be
# called before the email is sent, allowing you to make modifications to the email before it hits
# the delivery agents. Your class should make any needed modifications directly to the passed
# in +Mail::Message+ instance.
#
# == Default \Hash
#
# Action Mailer provides some intelligent defaults for your emails, these are usually specified in a
# default method inside the class definition:
#
#   class NotifierMailer < ApplicationMailer
#     default sender: 'system@example.com'
#   end
#
# You can pass in any header value that a +Mail::Message+ accepts. Out of the box,
# +ActionMailer::Base+ sets the following:
#
# * <tt>mime_version: "1.0"</tt>
# * <tt>charset:      "UTF-8"</tt>
# * <tt>content_type: "text/plain"</tt>
# * <tt>parts_order:  [ "text/plain", "text/enriched", "text/html" ]</tt>
#
# <tt>parts_order</tt> and <tt>charset</tt> are not actually valid +Mail::Message+ header fields,
# but Action Mailer translates them appropriately and sets the correct values.
#
# As you can pass in any header, you need to either quote the header as a string, or pass it in as
# an underscored symbol, so the following will work:
#
#   class NotifierMailer < ApplicationMailer
#     default 'Content-Transfer-Encoding' => '7bit',
#             content_description: 'This is a description'
#   end
#
# Finally, Action Mailer also supports passing <tt>Proc</tt> and <tt>Lambda</tt> objects into the default hash,
# so you can define methods that evaluate as the message is being generated:
#
#   class NotifierMailer < ApplicationMailer
#     default 'X-Special-Header' => Proc.new { my_method }, to: -> { @inviter.email_address }
#
#     private
#       def my_method
#         'some complex call'
#       end
#   end
#
# Note that the proc/lambda is evaluated right at the start of the mail message generation, so if you
# set something in the default hash using a proc, and then set the same thing inside of your
# mailer method, it will get overwritten by the mailer method.
#
# It is also possible to set these default options that will be used in all mailers through
# the <tt>default_options=</tt> configuration in <tt>config/application.rb</tt>:
#
#    config.action_mailer.default_options = { from: "no-reply@example.org" }
#
# == \Callbacks
#
# You can specify callbacks using <tt>before_action</tt> and <tt>after_action</tt> for configuring your messages,
# and using <tt>before_deliver</tt> and <tt>after_deliver</tt> for wrapping the delivery process.
# For example, when you want to add default inline attachments and log delivery for all messages
# sent out by a certain mailer class:
#
#   class NotifierMailer < ApplicationMailer
#     before_action :add_inline_attachment!
#     after_deliver :log_delivery
#
#     def welcome
#       mail
#     end
#
#     private
#       def add_inline_attachment!
#         attachments.inline["footer.jpg"] = File.read('/path/to/filename.jpg')
#       end
#
#       def log_delivery
#         Rails.logger.info "Sent email with message id '#{message.message_id}' at #{Time.current}."
#       end
#   end
#
# Action callbacks in Action Mailer are implemented using
# AbstractController::Callbacks, so you can define and configure
# callbacks in the same manner that you would use callbacks in classes that
# inherit from ActionController::Base.
#
# Note that unless you have a specific reason to do so, you should prefer
# using <tt>before_action</tt> rather than <tt>after_action</tt> in your
# Action Mailer classes so that headers are parsed properly.
#
# == Rescuing Errors
#
# +rescue+ blocks inside of a mailer method cannot rescue errors that occur
# outside of rendering -- for example, record deserialization errors in a
# background job, or errors from a third-party mail delivery service.
#
# To rescue errors that occur during any part of the mailing process, use
# {rescue_from}[rdoc-ref:ActiveSupport::Rescuable::ClassMethods#rescue_from]:
#
#   class NotifierMailer < ApplicationMailer
#     rescue_from ActiveJob::DeserializationError do
#       # ...
#     end
#
#     rescue_from "SomeThirdPartyService::ApiError" do
#       # ...
#     end
#
#     def notify(recipient)
#       mail(to: recipient, subject: "Notification")
#     end
#   end
#
# == Previewing emails
#
# You can preview your email templates visually by adding a mailer preview file to the
# <tt>ActionMailer::Base.preview_paths</tt>. Since most emails do something interesting
# with database data, you'll need to write some scenarios to load messages with fake data:
#
#   class NotifierMailerPreview < ActionMailer::Preview
#     def welcome
#       NotifierMailer.welcome(User.first)
#     end
#   end
#
# Methods must return a +Mail::Message+ object which can be generated by calling the mailer
# method without the additional <tt>deliver_now</tt> / <tt>deliver_later</tt>. The location of the
# mailer preview directories can be configured using the <tt>preview_paths</tt> option which has a default
# of <tt>test/mailers/previews</tt>:
#
#   config.action_mailer.preview_paths << "#{Rails.root}/lib/mailer_previews"
#
# An overview of all previews is accessible at <tt>http://localhost:3000/rails/mailers</tt>
# on a running development server instance.
#
# Previews can also be intercepted in a similar manner as deliveries can be by registering
# a preview interceptor that has a <tt>previewing_email</tt> method:
#
#   class CssInlineStyler
#     def self.previewing_email(message)
#       # inline CSS styles
#     end
#   end
#
#   config.action_mailer.preview_interceptors :css_inline_styler
#
# Note that interceptors need to be registered both with <tt>register_interceptor</tt>
# and <tt>register_preview_interceptor</tt> if they should operate on both sending and
# previewing emails.
#
# == Configuration options
#
# These options are specified on the class level, like
# <tt>ActionMailer::Base.raise_delivery_errors = true</tt>
#
# * <tt>default_options</tt> - You can pass this in at a class level as well as within the class itself as
#   per the above section.
#
# * <tt>logger</tt> - the logger is used for generating information on the mailing run if available.
#   Can be set to +nil+ for no logging. Compatible with both Ruby's own +Logger+ and Log4r loggers.
#
# * <tt>smtp_settings</tt> - Allows detailed configuration for <tt>:smtp</tt> delivery method:
#   * <tt>:address</tt> - Allows you to use a remote mail server. Just change it from its default
#     "localhost" setting.
#   * <tt>:port</tt> - On the off chance that your mail server doesn't run on port 25, you can change it.
#   * <tt>:domain</tt> - If you need to specify a HELO domain, you can do it here.
#   * <tt>:user_name</tt> - If your mail server requires authentication, set the username in this setting.
#   * <tt>:password</tt> - If your mail server requires authentication, set the password in this setting.
#   * <tt>:authentication</tt> - If your mail server requires authentication, you need to specify the
#     authentication type here.
#     This is a symbol and one of <tt>:plain</tt> (will send the password Base64 encoded), <tt>:login</tt> (will
#     send the password Base64 encoded) or <tt>:cram_md5</tt> (combines a Challenge/Response mechanism to exchange
#     information and a cryptographic Message Digest 5 algorithm to hash important information)
#   * <tt>:enable_starttls</tt> - Use STARTTLS when connecting to your SMTP server and fail if unsupported. Defaults
#     to <tt>false</tt>. Requires at least version 2.7 of the Mail gem.
#   * <tt>:enable_starttls_auto</tt> - Detects if STARTTLS is enabled in your SMTP server and starts
#     to use it. Defaults to <tt>true</tt>.
#   * <tt>:openssl_verify_mode</tt> - When using TLS, you can set how OpenSSL checks the certificate. This is
#     really useful if you need to validate a self-signed and/or a wildcard certificate. You can use the name
#     of an OpenSSL verify constant (<tt>'none'</tt> or <tt>'peer'</tt>) or directly the constant
#     (+OpenSSL::SSL::VERIFY_NONE+ or +OpenSSL::SSL::VERIFY_PEER+).
#   * <tt>:ssl/:tls</tt> Enables the SMTP connection to use SMTP/TLS (SMTPS: SMTP over direct TLS connection)
#   * <tt>:open_timeout</tt> Number of seconds to wait while attempting to open a connection.
#   * <tt>:read_timeout</tt> Number of seconds to wait until timing-out a read(2) call.
#
# * <tt>sendmail_settings</tt> - Allows you to override options for the <tt>:sendmail</tt> delivery method.
#   * <tt>:location</tt> - The location of the sendmail executable. Defaults to <tt>/usr/sbin/sendmail</tt>.
#   * <tt>:arguments</tt> - The command line arguments. Defaults to <tt>%w[ -i ]</tt> with <tt>-f sender@address</tt>
#     added automatically before the message is sent.
#
# * <tt>file_settings</tt> - Allows you to override options for the <tt>:file</tt> delivery method.
#   * <tt>:location</tt> - The directory into which emails will be written. Defaults to the application
#     <tt>tmp/mails</tt>.
#
# * <tt>raise_delivery_errors</tt> - Whether or not errors should be raised if the email fails to be delivered.
#
# * <tt>delivery_method</tt> - Defines a delivery method. Possible values are <tt>:smtp</tt> (default),
#   <tt>:sendmail</tt>, <tt>:test</tt>, and <tt>:file</tt>. Or you may provide a custom delivery method
#   object e.g. +MyOwnDeliveryMethodClass+. See the Mail gem documentation on the interface you need to
#   implement for a custom delivery agent.
#
# * <tt>perform_deliveries</tt> - Determines whether emails are actually sent from Action Mailer when you
#   call <tt>.deliver</tt> on an email message or on an Action Mailer method. This is on by default but can
#   be turned off to aid in functional testing.
#
# * <tt>deliveries</tt> - Keeps an array of all the emails sent out through the Action Mailer with
#   <tt>delivery_method :test</tt>. Most useful for unit and functional testing.
#
# * <tt>delivery_job</tt> - The job class used with <tt>deliver_later</tt>. Mailers can set this to use a
#   custom delivery job. Defaults to +ActionMailer::MailDeliveryJob+.
#
# * <tt>deliver_later_queue_name</tt> - The queue name used by <tt>deliver_later</tt> with the default
#   <tt>delivery_job</tt>. Mailers can set this to use a custom queue name.
#
# @abstract It cannot be directly instantiated. Subclasses must implement the `abstract` methods below.

  # Allows you to add attachments to an email, like so:
  #
  #  mail.attachments['filename.jpg'] = File.read('/path/to/filename.jpg')
  #
  # If you do this, then Mail will take the file name and work out the mime type.
  # It will also set the +Content-Type+, +Content-Disposition+, and +Content-Transfer-Encoding+,
  # and encode the contents of the attachment in Base64.
  #
  # You can also specify overrides if you want by passing a hash instead of a string:
  #
  #  mail.attachments['filename.jpg'] = {mime_type: 'application/gzip',

  #
  # If you want to use encoding other than Base64 then you will need to pass encoding
  # type along with the pre-encoded content as Mail doesn't know how to decode the
  # data:
  #
  #  file_content = SpecialEncode(File.read('/path/to/filename.jpg'))

  # The main method that creates the message and renders the email templates. There are
  # two ways to call this method, with a block, or without a block.
  #
  # It accepts a headers hash. This hash allows you to specify
  # the most used headers in an email message, these are:
  #
  # * +:subject+ - The subject of the message, if this is omitted, Action Mailer will
  #   ask the \Rails I18n class for a translated +:subject+ in the scope of
  #   <tt>[mailer_scope, action_name]</tt> or if this is missing, will translate the
  #   humanized version of the +action_name+
  # * +:to+ - Who the message is destined for, can be a string of addresses, or an array
  #   of addresses.
  # * +:from+ - Who the message is from
  # * +:cc+ - Who you would like to Carbon-Copy on this email, can be a string of addresses,
  #   or an array of addresses.
  # * +:bcc+ - Who you would like to Blind-Carbon-Copy on this email, can be a string of
  #   addresses, or an array of addresses.
  # * +:reply_to+ - Who to set the +Reply-To+ header of the email to.
  # * +:date+ - The date to say the email was sent on.
  #
  # You can set default values for any of the above headers (except +:date+)
  # by using the ::default class method:
  #
  #  class Notifier < ActionMailer::Base
  #    default from: 'no-reply@test.lindsaar.net',
  #            bcc: 'email_logger@test.lindsaar.net',
  #            reply_to: 'bounces@test.lindsaar.net'
  #  end
  #
  # If you need other headers not listed above, you can either pass them in
  # as part of the headers hash or use the <tt>headers['name'] = value</tt>
  # method.
  #
  # When a +:return_path+ is specified as header, that value will be used as
  # the 'envelope from' address for the Mail message. Setting this is useful
  # when you want delivery notifications sent to a different address than the
  # one in +:from+. Mail will actually use the +:return_path+ in preference
  # to the +:sender+ in preference to the +:from+ field for the 'envelope
  # from' value.
  #
  # If you do not pass a block to the +mail+ method, it will find all
  # templates in the view paths using by default the mailer name and the
  # method name that it is being called from, it will then create parts for
  # each of these templates intelligently, making educated guesses on correct
  # content type and sequence, and return a fully prepared +Mail::Message+
  # ready to call <tt>:deliver</tt> on to send.
  #
  # For example:
  #
  #   class Notifier < ActionMailer::Base
  #     default from: 'no-reply@test.lindsaar.net'
  #
  #     def welcome
  #       mail(to: 'mikel@test.lindsaar.net')
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  # Will look for all templates at "app/views/notifier" with name "welcome".
  # If no welcome template exists, it will raise an ActionView::MissingTemplate error.
  #
  # However, those can be customized:
  #
  #   mail(template_path: 'notifications', template_name: 'another')
  #
  # And now it will look for all templates at "app/views/notifications" with name "another".
  #
  # If you do pass a block, you can render specific templates of your choice:
  #
  #   mail(to: 'mikel@test.lindsaar.net') do |format|
  #     format.text
  #     format.html
  #   end
  #
  # You can even render plain text directly without using a template:
  #
  #   mail(to: 'mikel@test.lindsaar.net') do |format|
  #     format.text { render plain: "Hello Mikel!" }
  #     format.html { render html: "<h1>Hello Mikel!</h1>".html_safe }
  #   end
  #
  # Which will render a +multipart/alternative+ email with +text/plain+ and
  # +text/html+ parts.
  #
  # The block syntax also allows you to customize the part headers if desired:
  #
  #   mail(to: 'mikel@test.lindsaar.net') do |format|
  #     format.html
  #   end
