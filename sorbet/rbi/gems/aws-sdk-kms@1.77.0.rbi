  # Connects or reconnects a [custom key store][1] to its backing key
  # store. For an CloudHSM key store, `ConnectCustomKeyStore` connects the
  # key store to its associated CloudHSM cluster. For an external key
  # store, `ConnectCustomKeyStore` connects the key store to the external
  # key store proxy that communicates with your external key manager.
  #
  # The custom key store must be connected before you can create KMS keys
  # in the key store or use the KMS keys it contains. You can disconnect
  # and reconnect a custom key store at any time.
  #
  # The connection process for a custom key store can take an extended
  # amount of time to complete. This operation starts the connection
  # process, but it does not wait for it to complete. When it succeeds,
  # this operation quickly returns an HTTP 200 response and a JSON object
  # with no properties. However, this response does not indicate that the
  # custom key store is connected. To get the connection state of the
  # custom key store, use the DescribeCustomKeyStores operation.
  #
  # This operation is part of the [custom key stores][1] feature in KMS,
  # which combines the convenience and extensive integration of KMS with
  # the isolation and control of a key store that you own and manage.
  #
  # The `ConnectCustomKeyStore` operation might fail for various reasons.
  # To find the reason, use the DescribeCustomKeyStores operation and see
  # the `ConnectionErrorCode` in the response. For help interpreting the
  # `ConnectionErrorCode`, see CustomKeyStoresListEntry.
  #
  # To fix the failure, use the DisconnectCustomKeyStore operation to
  # disconnect the custom key store, correct the error, use the
  # UpdateCustomKeyStore operation if necessary, and then use
  # `ConnectCustomKeyStore` again.
  #
  # **CloudHSM key store**
  #
  # During the connection process for an CloudHSM key store, KMS finds the
  # CloudHSM cluster that is associated with the custom key store, creates
  # the connection infrastructure, connects to the cluster, logs into the
  # CloudHSM client as the `kmsuser` CU, and rotates its password.
  #
  # To connect an CloudHSM key store, its associated CloudHSM cluster must
  # have at least one active HSM. To get the number of active HSMs in a
  # cluster, use the [DescribeClusters][2] operation. To add HSMs to the
  # cluster, use the [CreateHsm][3] operation. Also, the [ `kmsuser`
  # crypto user][4] (CU) must not be logged into the cluster. This
  # prevents KMS from using this account to log in.
  #
  # If you are having trouble connecting or disconnecting a CloudHSM key
  # store, see [Troubleshooting an CloudHSM key store][5] in the *Key
  # Management Service Developer Guide*.
  #
  # **External key store**
  #
  # When you connect an external key store that uses public endpoint
  # connectivity, KMS tests its ability to communicate with your external
  # key manager by sending a request via the external key store proxy.
  #
  # When you connect to an external key store that uses VPC endpoint
  # service connectivity, KMS establishes the networking elements that it
  # needs to communicate with your external key manager via the external
  # key store proxy. This includes creating an interface endpoint to the
  # VPC endpoint service and a private hosted zone for traffic between KMS
  # and the VPC endpoint service.
  #
  # To connect an external key store, KMS must be able to connect to the
  # external key store proxy, the external key store proxy must be able to
  # communicate with your external key manager, and the external key
  # manager must be available for cryptographic operations.
  #
  # If you are having trouble connecting or disconnecting an external key
  # store, see [Troubleshooting an external key store][6] in the *Key
  # Management Service Developer Guide*.
  #
  # **Cross-account use**: No. You cannot perform this operation on a
  # custom key store in a different Amazon Web Services account.
  #
  # **Required permissions**: [kms:ConnectCustomKeyStore][7] (IAM policy)

  #
  # You can use an alias to identify a KMS key in the KMS console, in the

  #
  # You can associate the alias with any customer managed key in the same
  # Amazon Web Services Region. Each alias is associated with only one KMS
  # key at a time, but a KMS key can have multiple aliases. A valid KMS
  # key is required. You can't create an alias without a KMS key.
  #
  # The alias must be unique in the account and Region, but you can have

  # Creates a [custom key store][1] backed by a key store that you own and
  # manage. When you use a KMS key in a custom key store for a
  # cryptographic operation, the cryptographic operation is actually
  # performed in your key store using your keys. KMS supports [CloudHSM
  # key stores][2] backed by an [CloudHSM cluster][3] and [external key
  # stores][4] backed by an external key store proxy and external key
  # manager outside of Amazon Web Services.
  #
  # This operation is part of the [custom key stores][1] feature in KMS,
  # which combines the convenience and extensive integration of KMS with
  # the isolation and control of a key store that you own and manage.
  #
  # Before you create the custom key store, the required elements must be
  # in place and operational. We recommend that you use the test tools
  # that KMS provides to verify the configuration your external key store
  # proxy. For details about the required elements and verification tests,
  # see [Assemble the prerequisites (for CloudHSM key stores)][5] or
  # [Assemble the prerequisites (for external key stores)][6] in the *Key
  # Management Service Developer Guide*.
  #
  # To create a custom key store, use the following parameters.
  #
  # * To create an CloudHSM key store, specify the `CustomKeyStoreName`,
  #   `CloudHsmClusterId`, `KeyStorePassword`, and
  #   `TrustAnchorCertificate`. The `CustomKeyStoreType` parameter is
  #   optional for CloudHSM key stores. If you include it, set it to the
  #   default value, `AWS_CLOUDHSM`. For help with failures, see
  #   [Troubleshooting an CloudHSM key store][7] in the *Key Management
  #   Service Developer Guide*.
  #
  # * To create an external key store, specify the `CustomKeyStoreName`
  #   and a `CustomKeyStoreType` of `EXTERNAL_KEY_STORE`. Also, specify
  #   values for `XksProxyConnectivity`,
  #   `XksProxyAuthenticationCredential`, `XksProxyUriEndpoint`, and
  #   `XksProxyUriPath`. If your `XksProxyConnectivity` value is
  #   `VPC_ENDPOINT_SERVICE`, specify the `XksProxyVpcEndpointServiceName`
  #   parameter. For help with failures, see [Troubleshooting an external
  #   key store][8] in the *Key Management Service Developer Guide*.
  #
  # <note markdown="1"> For external key stores:
  #
  #  Some external key managers provide a simpler method for creating an
  # external key store. For details, see your external key manager
  # documentation.
  #
  #  When creating an external key store in the KMS console, you can upload
  # a JSON-based proxy configuration file with the desired values. You
  # cannot use a proxy configuration with the `CreateCustomKeyStore`
  # operation. However, you can use the values in the file to help you
  # determine the correct values for the `CreateCustomKeyStore`
  # parameters.
  #
  #  </note>
  #
  # When the operation completes successfully, it returns the ID of the
  # new custom key store. Before you can use your new custom key store,
  # you need to use the ConnectCustomKeyStore operation to connect a new
  # CloudHSM key store to its CloudHSM cluster, or to connect a new
  # external key store to the external key store proxy for your external
  # key manager. Even if you are not going to use your custom key store
  # immediately, you might want to connect it to verify that all settings
  # are correct and then disconnect it until you are ready to use it.
  #
  # For help with failures, see [Troubleshooting a custom key store][7] in
  # the *Key Management Service Developer Guide*.
  #
  # **Cross-account use**: No. You cannot perform this operation on a
  # custom key store in a different Amazon Web Services account.

  # Adds a grant to a KMS key.
  #
  # A *grant* is a policy instrument that allows Amazon Web Services
  # principals to use KMS keys in cryptographic operations. It also can
  # allow them to view a KMS key (DescribeKey) and create and manage
  # grants. When authorizing access to a KMS key, grants are considered
  # along with key policies and IAM policies. Grants are often used for
  # temporary permissions because you can create one, use its permissions,
  # and delete it without changing your key policies or IAM policies.
  #
  # For detailed information about grants, including grant terminology,
  # see [Grants in KMS][1] in the <i> <i>Key Management Service Developer
  # Guide</i> </i>. For examples of working with grants in several
  # programming languages, see [Programming grants][2].
  #
  # The `CreateGrant` operation returns a `GrantToken` and a `GrantId`.
  #
  # * When you create, retire, or revoke a grant, there might be a brief
  #   delay, usually less than five minutes, until the grant is available
  #   throughout KMS. This state is known as *eventual consistency*. Once
  #   the grant has achieved eventual consistency, the grantee principal
  #   can use the permissions in the grant without identifying the grant.
  #
  #   However, to use the permissions in the grant immediately, use the
  #   `GrantToken` that `CreateGrant` returns. For details, see [Using a
  #   grant token][3] in the <i> <i>Key Management Service Developer
  #   Guide</i> </i>.
  #
  # * The `CreateGrant` operation also returns a `GrantId`. You can use
  #   the `GrantId` and a key identifier to identify the grant in the
  #   RetireGrant and RevokeGrant operations. To find the grant ID, use
  #   the ListGrants or ListRetirableGrants operations.
  #
  # The KMS key that you use for this operation must be in a compatible
  # key state. For details, see [Key states of KMS keys][4] in the *Key
  # Management Service Developer Guide*.
  #
  # **Cross-account use**: Yes. To perform this operation on a KMS key in
  # a different Amazon Web Services account, specify the key ARN in the
  # value of the `KeyId` parameter.
  #
  # **Required permissions**: [kms:CreateGrant][5] (key policy)
  #
  # **Related operations:**
  #
  # * ListGrants
  #
  # * ListRetirableGrants
  #
  # * RetireGrant
  #
  # * RevokeGrant
  #
  # **Eventual consistency**: The KMS API follows an eventual consistency
  # model. For more information, see [KMS eventual consistency][6].

  # Creates a unique customer managed [KMS key][1] in your Amazon Web
  # Services account and Region. You can use a KMS key in cryptographic
  # operations, such as encryption and signing. Some Amazon Web Services
  # services let you use KMS keys that you create and manage to protect
  # your service resources.
  #
  # A KMS key is a logical representation of a cryptographic key. In
  # addition to the key material used in cryptographic operations, a KMS
  # key includes metadata, such as the key ID, key policy, creation date,
  # description, and key state. For details, see [Managing keys][2] in the
  # *Key Management Service Developer Guide*
  #
  # Use the parameters of `CreateKey` to specify the type of KMS key, the
  # source of its key material, its key policy, description, tags, and
  # other properties.
  #
  # <note markdown="1"> KMS has replaced the term *customer master key (CMK)* with *KMS key*
  # and *KMS key*. The concept has not changed. To prevent breaking
  # changes, KMS is keeping some variations of this term.
  #
  #  </note>
  #
  # To create different types of KMS keys, use the following guidance:
  #
  # Symmetric encryption KMS key
  #
  # : By default, `CreateKey` creates a symmetric encryption KMS key with
  #   key material that KMS generates. This is the basic and most widely
  #   used type of KMS key, and provides the best performance.
  #
  #   To create a symmetric encryption KMS key, you don't need to specify
  #   any parameters. The default value for `KeySpec`,
  #   `SYMMETRIC_DEFAULT`, the default value for `KeyUsage`,
  #   `ENCRYPT_DECRYPT`, and the default value for `Origin`, `AWS_KMS`,
  #   create a symmetric encryption KMS key with KMS key material.
  #
  #   If you need a key for basic encryption and decryption or you are
  #   creating a KMS key to protect your resources in an Amazon Web
  #   Services service, create a symmetric encryption KMS key. The key
  #   material in a symmetric encryption key never leaves KMS unencrypted.
  #   You can use a symmetric encryption KMS key to encrypt and decrypt
  #   data up to 4,096 bytes, but they are typically used to generate data
  #   keys and data keys pairs. For details, see GenerateDataKey and
  #   GenerateDataKeyPair.
  #
  #
  #
  # Asymmetric KMS keys
  #
  # : To create an asymmetric KMS key, use the `KeySpec` parameter to
  #   specify the type of key material in the KMS key. Then, use the
  #   `KeyUsage` parameter to determine whether the KMS key will be used
  #   to encrypt and decrypt or sign and verify. You can't change these
  #   properties after the KMS key is created.
  #
  #   Asymmetric KMS keys contain an RSA key pair, Elliptic Curve (ECC)
  #   key pair, or an SM2 key pair (China Regions only). The private key
  #   in an asymmetric KMS key never leaves KMS unencrypted. However, you
  #   can use the GetPublicKey operation to download the public key so it
  #   can be used outside of KMS. KMS keys with RSA or SM2 key pairs can
  #   be used to encrypt or decrypt data or sign and verify messages (but
  #   not both). KMS keys with ECC key pairs can be used only to sign and
  #   verify messages. For information about asymmetric KMS keys, see
  #   [Asymmetric KMS keys][3] in the *Key Management Service Developer
  #   Guide*.
  #
  #
  #
  # HMAC KMS key
  #
  # : To create an HMAC KMS key, set the `KeySpec` parameter to a key spec
  #   value for HMAC KMS keys. Then set the `KeyUsage` parameter to
  #   `GENERATE_VERIFY_MAC`. You must set the key usage even though
  #   `GENERATE_VERIFY_MAC` is the only valid key usage value for HMAC KMS
  #   keys. You can't change these properties after the KMS key is
  #   created.
  #
  #   HMAC KMS keys are symmetric keys that never leave KMS unencrypted.
  #   You can use HMAC keys to generate (GenerateMac) and verify
  #   (VerifyMac) HMAC codes for messages up to 4096 bytes.
  #
  #
  #
  # Multi-Region primary keys
  # Imported key material
  #
  # : To create a multi-Region *primary key* in the local Amazon Web
  #   Services Region, use the `MultiRegion` parameter with a value of
  #   `True`. To create a multi-Region *replica key*, that is, a KMS key
  #   with the same key ID and key material as a primary key, but in a
  #   different Amazon Web Services Region, use the ReplicateKey
  #   operation. To change a replica key to a primary key, and its primary
  #   key to a replica key, use the UpdatePrimaryRegion operation.
  #
  #   You can create multi-Region KMS keys for all supported KMS key
  #   types: symmetric encryption KMS keys, HMAC KMS keys, asymmetric
  #   encryption KMS keys, and asymmetric signing KMS keys. You can also
  #   create multi-Region keys with imported key material. However, you
  #   can't create multi-Region keys in a custom key store.
  #
  #   This operation supports *multi-Region keys*, an KMS feature that
  #   lets you create multiple interoperable KMS keys in different Amazon
  #   Web Services Regions. Because these KMS keys have the same key ID,
  #   key material, and other metadata, you can use them interchangeably
  #   to encrypt data in one Amazon Web Services Region and decrypt it in
  #   a different Amazon Web Services Region without re-encrypting the
  #   data or making a cross-Region call. For more information about
  #   multi-Region keys, see [Multi-Region keys in KMS][4] in the *Key
  #   Management Service Developer Guide*.
  #
  #
  #
  # : To import your own key material into a KMS key, begin by creating a
  #   KMS key with no key material. To do this, use the `Origin` parameter
  #   of `CreateKey` with a value of `EXTERNAL`. Next, use
  #   GetParametersForImport operation to get a public key and import
  #   token. Use the wrapping public key to encrypt your key material.
  #   Then, use ImportKeyMaterial with your import token to import the key
  #   material. For step-by-step instructions, see [Importing Key
  #   Material][5] in the <i> <i>Key Management Service Developer
  #   Guide</i> </i>.
  #
  #   You can import key material into KMS keys of all supported KMS key
  #   types: symmetric encryption KMS keys, HMAC KMS keys, asymmetric
  #   encryption KMS keys, and asymmetric signing KMS keys. You can also
  #   create multi-Region keys with imported key material. However, you
  #   can't import key material into a KMS key in a custom key store.
  #
  #   To create a multi-Region primary key with imported key material, use
  #   the `Origin` parameter of `CreateKey` with a value of `EXTERNAL` and
  #   the `MultiRegion` parameter with a value of `True`. To create
  #   replicas of the multi-Region primary key, use the ReplicateKey
  #   operation. For instructions, see [Importing key material into
  #   multi-Region keys][6]. For more information about multi-Region keys,
  #   see [Multi-Region keys in KMS][4] in the *Key Management Service
  #   Developer Guide*.
  #
  #
  #
  # Custom key store
  #
  # : A [custom key store][7] lets you protect your Amazon Web Services
  #   resources using keys in a backing key store that you own and manage.
  #   When you request a cryptographic operation with a KMS key in a
  #   custom key store, the operation is performed in the backing key
  #   store using its cryptographic keys.
  #
  #   KMS supports [CloudHSM key stores][8] backed by an CloudHSM cluster
  #   and [external key stores][9] backed by an external key manager
  #   outside of Amazon Web Services. When you create a KMS key in an
  #   CloudHSM key store, KMS generates an encryption key in the CloudHSM
  #   cluster and associates it with the KMS key. When you create a KMS
  #   key in an external key store, you specify an existing encryption key
  #   in the external key manager.
  #
  #   <note markdown="1"> Some external key managers provide a simpler method for creating a
  #   KMS key in an external key store. For details, see your external key
  #   manager documentation.
  #
  #    </note>
  #
  #   Before you create a KMS key in a custom key store, the
  #   `ConnectionState` of the key store must be `CONNECTED`. To connect
  #   the custom key store, use the ConnectCustomKeyStore operation. To
  #   find the `ConnectionState`, use the DescribeCustomKeyStores
  #   operation.
  #
  #   To create a KMS key in a custom key store, use the
  #   `CustomKeyStoreId`. Use the default `KeySpec` value,
  #   `SYMMETRIC_DEFAULT`, and the default `KeyUsage` value,
  #   `ENCRYPT_DECRYPT` to create a symmetric encryption key. No other key
  #   type is supported in a custom key store.
  #
  #   To create a KMS key in an [CloudHSM key store][8], use the `Origin`
  #   parameter with a value of `AWS_CLOUDHSM`. The CloudHSM cluster that
  #   is associated with the custom key store must have at least two
  #   active HSMs in different Availability Zones in the Amazon Web
  #   Services Region.
  #
  #   To create a KMS key in an [external key store][9], use the `Origin`
  #   parameter with a value of `EXTERNAL_KEY_STORE` and an `XksKeyId`
  #   parameter that identifies an existing external key.
  #
  #   <note markdown="1"> Some external key managers provide a simpler method for creating a
  #   KMS key in an external key store. For details, see your external key
  #   manager documentation.
  #
  #    </note>
  #
  # **Cross-account use**: No. You cannot use this operation to create a
  # KMS key in a different Amazon Web Services account.
  #
  # **Required permissions**: [kms:CreateKey][10] (IAM policy). To use the
  # `Tags` parameter, [kms:TagResource][10] (IAM policy). For examples and
  # information about related permissions, see [Allow a user to create KMS
  # keys][11] in the *Key Management Service Developer Guide*.
  #

  # * DescribeKey
  #
  # * ListKeys
  #
  # * ScheduleKeyDeletion
  #
  # **Eventual consistency**: The KMS API follows an eventual consistency
  # model. For more information, see [KMS eventual consistency][12].

  # * GenerateDataKey
  #
  # * GenerateDataKeyPair
  #
  # * GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext
  #
  # * GenerateDataKeyPairWithoutPlaintext
  #
  # You can use this operation to decrypt ciphertext that was encrypted
  # under a symmetric encryption KMS key or an asymmetric encryption KMS
  # key. When the KMS key is asymmetric, you must specify the KMS key and
  # the encryption algorithm that was used to encrypt the ciphertext. For
  # information about asymmetric KMS keys, see [Asymmetric KMS keys][1] in
  # the *Key Management Service Developer Guide*.
  #
  # The `Decrypt` operation also decrypts ciphertext that was encrypted
  # outside of KMS by the public key in an KMS asymmetric KMS key.
  # However, it cannot decrypt symmetric ciphertext produced by other
  # libraries, such as the [Amazon Web Services Encryption SDK][2] or
  # [Amazon S3 client-side encryption][3]. These libraries return a
  # ciphertext format that is incompatible with KMS.
  #
  # If the ciphertext was encrypted under a symmetric encryption KMS key,
  # the `KeyId` parameter is optional. KMS can get this information from
  # metadata that it adds to the symmetric ciphertext blob. This feature
  # adds durability to your implementation by ensuring that authorized
  # users can decrypt ciphertext decades after it was encrypted, even if
  # they've lost track of the key ID. However, specifying the KMS key is
  # always recommended as a best practice. When you use the `KeyId`
  # parameter to specify a KMS key, KMS only uses the KMS key you specify.
  # If the ciphertext was encrypted under a different KMS key, the
  # `Decrypt` operation fails. This practice ensures that you use the KMS
  # key that you intend.
  #
  # Whenever possible, use key policies to give users permission to call
  # the `Decrypt` operation on a particular KMS key, instead of using
  # &amp;IAM; policies. Otherwise, you might create an &amp;IAM; policy
  # that gives the user `Decrypt` permission on all KMS keys. This user
  # could decrypt ciphertext that was encrypted by KMS keys in other
  # accounts if the key policy for the cross-account KMS key permits it.
  # If you must use an IAM policy for `Decrypt` permissions, limit the
  # user to particular KMS keys or particular trusted accounts. For
  # details, see [Best practices for IAM policies][4] in the *Key
  # Management Service Developer Guide*.
  #
  # `Decrypt` also supports [Amazon Web Services Nitro Enclaves][5], which
  # provide an isolated compute environment in Amazon EC2. To call
  # `Decrypt` for a Nitro enclave, use the [Amazon Web Services Nitro
  # Enclaves SDK][6] or any Amazon Web Services SDK. Use the `Recipient`
  # parameter to provide the attestation document for the enclave. Instead
  # of the plaintext data, the response includes the plaintext data
  # encrypted with the public key from the attestation document
  # (`CiphertextForRecipient`). For information about the interaction
  # between KMS and Amazon Web Services Nitro Enclaves, see [How Amazon
  # Web Services Nitro Enclaves uses KMS][7] in the *Key Management
  # Service Developer Guide*.
  #
  # The KMS key that you use for this operation must be in a compatible
  # key state. For details, see [Key states of KMS keys][8] in the *Key
  # Management Service Developer Guide*.
  #
  # **Cross-account use**: Yes. If you use the `KeyId` parameter to
  # identify a KMS key in a different Amazon Web Services account, specify
  # the key ARN or the alias ARN of the KMS key.
  #
  # **Required permissions**: [kms:Decrypt][9] (key policy)

  # Deletes a [custom key store][1]. This operation does not affect any
  # backing elements of the custom key store. It does not delete the
  # CloudHSM cluster that is associated with an CloudHSM key store, or
  # affect any users or keys in the cluster. For an external key store, it
  # does not affect the external key store proxy, external key manager, or
  # any external keys.
  #
  # This operation is part of the [custom key stores][1] feature in KMS,
  # which combines the convenience and extensive integration of KMS with
  # the isolation and control of a key store that you own and manage.
  #
  # The custom key store that you delete cannot contain any [KMS keys][2].
  # Before deleting the key store, verify that you will never need to use
  # any of the KMS keys in the key store for any [cryptographic
  # operations][3]. Then, use ScheduleKeyDeletion to delete the KMS keys
  # from the key store. After the required waiting period expires and all
  # KMS keys are deleted from the custom key store, use
  # DisconnectCustomKeyStore to disconnect the key store from KMS. Then,
  # you can delete the custom key store.
  #
  # For keys in an CloudHSM key store, the `ScheduleKeyDeletion` operation
  # makes a best effort to delete the key material from the associated
  # cluster. However, you might need to manually [delete the orphaned key
  # material][4] from the cluster and its backups. KMS never creates,
  # manages, or deletes cryptographic keys in the external key manager
  # associated with an external key store. You must manage them using your
  # external key manager tools.
  #
  # Instead of deleting the custom key store, consider using the
  # DisconnectCustomKeyStore operation to disconnect the custom key store
  # from its backing key store. While the key store is disconnected, you
  # cannot create or use the KMS keys in the key store. But, you do not
  # need to delete KMS keys and you can reconnect a disconnected custom
  # key store at any time.
  #
  # If the operation succeeds, it returns a JSON object with no
  # properties.
  #
  # **Cross-account use**: No. You cannot perform this operation on a
  # custom key store in a different Amazon Web Services account.

  #
  # This operation is part of the [custom key stores][1] feature in KMS,
  # which combines the convenience and extensive integration of KMS with
  # the isolation and control of a key store that you own and manage.
  #
  # By default, this operation returns information about all custom key
  # stores in the account and Region. To get only information about a
  # particular custom key store, use either the `CustomKeyStoreName` or
  # `CustomKeyStoreId` parameter (but not both).
  #
  # To determine whether the custom key store is connected to its CloudHSM
  # cluster or external key store proxy, use the `ConnectionState` element
  # in the response. If an attempt to connect the custom key store failed,
  # the `ConnectionState` value is `FAILED` and the `ConnectionErrorCode`
  # element in the response indicates the cause of the failure. For help
  # interpreting the `ConnectionErrorCode`, see CustomKeyStoresListEntry.
  #
  # Custom key stores have a `DISCONNECTED` connection state if the key
  # store has never been connected or you used the
  # DisconnectCustomKeyStore operation to disconnect it. Otherwise, the
  # connection state is CONNECTED. If your custom key store connection
  # state is `CONNECTED` but you are having trouble using it, verify that
  # the backing store is active and available. For an CloudHSM key store,
  # verify that the associated CloudHSM cluster is active and contains the
  # minimum number of HSMs required for the operation, if any. For an
  # external key store, verify that the external key store proxy and its
  # associated external key manager are reachable and enabled.
  #
  # For help repairing your CloudHSM key store, see the [Troubleshooting

  #
  # This detailed information includes the key ARN, creation date (and

  # expiration date (if any) of the key material. It includes fields, like
  # `KeySpec`, that help you distinguish different types of KMS keys. It
  # also displays the key usage (encryption, signing, or generating and
  # verifying MACs) and the algorithms that the KMS key supports.
  #
  # For [multi-Region keys][3], `DescribeKey` displays the primary key and
  # all related replica keys. For KMS keys in [CloudHSM key stores][4], it
  # includes information about the key store, such as the key store ID and
  # the CloudHSM cluster ID. For KMS keys in [external key stores][5], it
  # includes the custom key store ID and the ID of the external key.
  #
  # `DescribeKey` does not return the following information:
  #
  # * Aliases associated with the KMS key. To get this information, use
  #   ListAliases.
  #
  # * Whether automatic key rotation is enabled on the KMS key. To get
  #   this information, use GetKeyRotationStatus. Also, some key states
  #   prevent a KMS key from being automatically rotated. For details, see
  #   [How Automatic Key Rotation Works][6] in the *Key Management Service
  #   Developer Guide*.
  #
  # * Tags on the KMS key. To get this information, use ListResourceTags.
  #
  # * Key policies and grants on the KMS key. To get this information, use
  #   GetKeyPolicy and ListGrants.
  #
  # In general, `DescribeKey` is a non-mutating operation. It returns data
  # about KMS keys, but doesn't change them. However, Amazon Web Services
  # services use `DescribeKey` to create [Amazon Web Services managed
  # keys][2] from a *predefined Amazon Web Services alias* with no key ID.
  #
  # **Cross-account use**: Yes. To perform this operation with a KMS key
  # in a different Amazon Web Services account, specify the key ARN or

  # Enables [automatic rotation of the key material][1] of the specified
  # symmetric encryption KMS key.
  #
  # When you enable automatic rotation of a [customer managed KMS key][2],
  # KMS rotates the key material of the KMS key one year (approximately
  # 365 days) from the enable date and every year thereafter. You can
  # monitor rotation of the key material for your KMS keys in CloudTrail
  # and Amazon CloudWatch. To disable rotation of the key material in a
  # customer managed KMS key, use the DisableKeyRotation operation.
  #
  # Automatic key rotation is supported only on [symmetric encryption KMS
  # keys][3]. You cannot enable automatic rotation of [asymmetric KMS
  # keys][4], [HMAC KMS keys][5], KMS keys with [imported key
  # material][6], or KMS keys in a [custom key store][7]. To enable or
  # disable automatic rotation of a set of related [multi-Region keys][8],
  # set the property on the primary key.
  #
  # You cannot enable or disable automatic rotation [Amazon Web Services
  # managed KMS keys][9]. KMS always rotates the key material of Amazon
  # Web Services managed keys every year. Rotation of [Amazon Web Services
  # owned KMS keys][10] varies.
  #
  # <note markdown="1"> In May 2022, KMS changed the rotation schedule for Amazon Web Services
  # managed keys from every three years (approximately 1,095 days) to
  # every year (approximately 365 days).
  #
  #  New Amazon Web Services managed keys are automatically rotated one
  # year after they are created, and approximately every year thereafter.
  #
  #  Existing Amazon Web Services managed keys are automatically rotated
  # one year after their most recent rotation, and every year thereafter.

  # and 256-bit data keys, use the `KeySpec` parameter.
  #
  # To generate a 128-bit SM4 data key (China Regions only), specify a

  #
  # **How to use your data key**
  #
  # We recommend that you use the following pattern to encrypt data
  # locally in your application. You can write your own code or use a
  # client-side encryption library, such as the [Amazon Web Services
  # Encryption SDK][6], the [Amazon DynamoDB Encryption Client][7], or
  # [Amazon S3 client-side encryption][8] to do these tasks for you.
  #
  # To encrypt data outside of KMS:
  #
  # 1.  Use the `GenerateDataKey` operation to get a data key.
  #
  # 2.  Use the plaintext data key (in the `Plaintext` field of the
  #     response) to encrypt your data outside of KMS. Then erase the
  #     plaintext data key from memory.
  #
  # 3.  Store the encrypted data key (in the `CiphertextBlob` field of the
  #     response) with the encrypted data.
  #
  # To decrypt data outside of KMS:
  #
  # 1.  Use the Decrypt operation to decrypt the encrypted data key. The
  #     operation returns a plaintext copy of the data key.
  #
  # 2.  Use the plaintext data key to decrypt data outside of KMS, then
  #     erase the plaintext data key from memory.
  #
  # **Cross-account use**: Yes. To perform this operation with a KMS key
  # in a different Amazon Web Services account, specify the key ARN or
  # alias ARN in the value of the `KeyId` parameter.

  #
  # You can use the public key that `GenerateDataKeyPair` returns to

  #
  # To generate a data key pair, you must specify a symmetric encryption
  # KMS key to encrypt the private key in a data key pair. You cannot use
  # an asymmetric KMS key or a KMS key in a custom key store. To get the

  #
  # Use the `KeyPairSpec` parameter to choose an RSA or Elliptic Curve

  # key pairs outside of KMS.
  #
  # If you are using the data key pair to encrypt data, or for any
  # operation where you don't immediately need a private key, consider
  # using the GenerateDataKeyPairWithoutPlaintext operation.
  # `GenerateDataKeyPairWithoutPlaintext` returns a plaintext public key
  # and an encrypted private key, but omits the plaintext private key that
  # you need only to decrypt ciphertext or sign a message. Later, when you
  # need to decrypt the data or sign a message, use the Decrypt operation
  # to decrypt the encrypted private key in the data key pair.
  #
  # `GenerateDataKeyPair` returns a unique data key pair for each request.
  # The bytes in the keys are random; they are not related to the caller
  # or the KMS key that is used to encrypt the private key. The public key

  # Gets a Boolean value that indicates whether [automatic rotation of the

  #
  # When you enable automatic rotation for [customer managed KMS keys][2],
  # KMS rotates the key material of the KMS key one year (approximately
  # 365 days) from the enable date and every year thereafter. You can
  # monitor rotation of the key material for your KMS keys in CloudTrail
  # and Amazon CloudWatch.
  #
  # Automatic key rotation is supported only on [symmetric encryption KMS
  # keys][3]. You cannot enable automatic rotation of [asymmetric KMS
  # keys][4], [HMAC KMS keys][5], KMS keys with [imported key
  # material][6], or KMS keys in a [custom key store][7]. To enable or
  # disable automatic rotation of a set of related [multi-Region keys][8],
  # set the property on the primary key..
  #
  # You can enable (EnableKeyRotation) and disable automatic rotation
  # (DisableKeyRotation) of the key material in customer managed KMS keys.
  # Key material rotation of [Amazon Web Services managed KMS keys][9] is
  # not configurable. KMS always rotates the key material in Amazon Web
  # Services managed KMS keys every year. The key rotation status for
  # Amazon Web Services managed KMS keys is always `true`.
  #
  # <note markdown="1"> In May 2022, KMS changed the rotation schedule for Amazon Web Services
  # managed keys from every three years to every year. For details, see
  # EnableKeyRotation.
  #
  #  </note>
  #
  # The KMS key that you use for this operation must be in a compatible
  # key state. For details, see [Key states of KMS keys][10] in the *Key
  # Management Service Developer Guide*.
  #
  # * Disabled: The key rotation status does not change when you disable a
  #   KMS key. However, while the KMS key is disabled, KMS does not rotate
  #   the key material. When you re-enable the KMS key, rotation resumes.
  #   If the key material in the re-enabled KMS key hasn't been rotated
  #   in one year, KMS rotates it immediately, and every year thereafter.
  #   If it's been less than a year since the key material in the
  #   re-enabled KMS key was rotated, the KMS key resumes its prior
  #   rotation schedule.
  #
  # * Pending deletion: While a KMS key is pending deletion, its key
  #   rotation status is `false` and KMS does not rotate the key material.
  #   If you cancel the deletion, the original key rotation status returns
  #   to `true`.
  #

  # Returns the public key and an import token you need to import or

  # material for a KMS key. For more information about importing key
  # material into KMS, see [Importing key material][1] in the *Key
  # Management Service Developer Guide*.
  #
  # Before calling `GetParametersForImport`, use the CreateKey operation
  # with an `Origin` value of `EXTERNAL` to create a KMS key with no key
  # material. You can import key material for a symmetric encryption KMS
  # key, HMAC KMS key, asymmetric encryption KMS key, or asymmetric
  # signing KMS key. You can also import key material into a [multi-Region
  # key][2] of any supported type. However, you can't import key material
  # into a KMS key in a [custom key store][3]. You can also use
  # `GetParametersForImport` to get a public key and import token to
  # [reimport the original key material][4] into a KMS key whose key
  # material expired or was deleted.
  #
  # `GetParametersForImport` returns the items that you need to import

  #
  # * The public key (or "wrapping key") of an RSA key pair that KMS
  #   generates.
  #
  #   You will use this public key to encrypt ("wrap") your key material
  #   while it's in transit to KMS.
  #
  # * A import token that ensures that KMS can decrypt your key material
  #   and associate it with the correct KMS key.
  #
  # The public key and its import token are permanently linked and must be
  # used together. Each public key and import token set is valid for 24
  # hours. The expiration date and time appear in the `ParametersValidTo`
  # field in the `GetParametersForImport` response. You cannot use an
  # expired public key or import token in an ImportKeyMaterial request. If
  # your key and token expire, send another `GetParametersForImport`
  # request.
  #
  # `GetParametersForImport` requires the following information:
  #
  # * The key ID of the KMS key for which you are importing the key
  #   material.
  #
  # * The key spec of the public key ("wrapping key") that you will use
  #   to encrypt your key material during import.
  #
  # * The wrapping algorithm that you will use with the public key to
  #   encrypt your key material.
  #
  # You can use the same or a different public key spec and wrapping
  # algorithm each time you import or reimport the same key material.
  #
  # The KMS key that you use for this operation must be in a compatible

  # Returns the public key of an asymmetric KMS key. Unlike the private
  # key of a asymmetric KMS key, which never leaves KMS unencrypted,
  # callers with `kms:GetPublicKey` permission can download the public key
  # of an asymmetric KMS key. You can share the public key to allow others
  # to encrypt messages and verify signatures outside of KMS. For
  # information about asymmetric KMS keys, see [Asymmetric KMS keys][1] in
  # the *Key Management Service Developer Guide*.
  #
  # You do not need to download the public key. Instead, you can use the
  # public key within KMS by calling the Encrypt, ReEncrypt, or Verify
  # operations with the identifier of an asymmetric KMS key. When you use
  # the public key within KMS, you benefit from the authentication,
  # authorization, and logging that are part of every KMS operation. You
  # also reduce of risk of encrypting data that cannot be decrypted. These
  # features are not effective outside of KMS.
  #
  # To help you use the public key safely outside of KMS, `GetPublicKey`
  # returns important information about the public key in the response,
  # including:
  #
  # * [KeySpec][2]: The type of key material in the public key, such as
  #   `RSA_4096` or `ECC_NIST_P521`.
  #
  # * [KeyUsage][3]: Whether the key is used for encryption or signing.
  #
  # * [EncryptionAlgorithms][4] or [SigningAlgorithms][5]: A list of the
  #   encryption algorithms or the signing algorithms for the key.
  #
  # Although KMS cannot enforce these restrictions on external operations,
  # it is crucial that you use this information to prevent the public key
  # from being used improperly. For example, you can prevent a public
  # signing key from being used encrypt data, or prevent a public key from
  # being used with an encryption algorithm that is not supported by KMS.
  # You can also avoid errors, such as using the wrong signing algorithm
  # in a verification operation.
  #
  # To verify a signature outside of KMS with an SM2 public key (China
  # Regions only), you must specify the distinguishing ID. By default, KMS
  # uses `1234567812345678` as the distinguishing ID. For more
  # information, see [Offline verification with SM2 key pairs][6].
  #
  # The KMS key that you use for this operation must be in a compatible
  # key state. For details, see [Key states of KMS keys][7] in the *Key
  # Management Service Developer Guide*.
  #
  # **Cross-account use**: Yes. To perform this operation with a KMS key
  # in a different Amazon Web Services account, specify the key ARN or
  # alias ARN in the value of the `KeyId` parameter.
  #
  # **Required permissions**: [kms:GetPublicKey][8] (key policy)
  #
  # **Related operations**: CreateKey
  #
  # **Eventual consistency**: The KMS API follows an eventual consistency
  # model. For more information, see [KMS eventual consistency][9].

  # Imports or reimports key material into an existing KMS key that was
  # created without key material. `ImportKeyMaterial` also sets the
  # expiration model and expiration date of the imported key material.
  #
  # By default, KMS keys are created with key material that KMS generates.
  # This operation supports [Importing key material][1], an advanced
  # feature that lets you generate and import the cryptographic key
  # material for a KMS key. For more information about importing key
  # material into KMS, see [Importing key material][1] in the *Key
  # Management Service Developer Guide*.
  #
  # After you successfully import key material into a KMS key, you can
  # [reimport the same key material][2] into that KMS key, but you cannot
  # import different key material. You might reimport key material to
  # replace key material that expired or key material that you deleted.
  # You might also reimport key material to change the expiration model or
  # expiration date of the key material. Before reimporting key material,
  # if necessary, call DeleteImportedKeyMaterial to delete the current
  # imported key material.
  #
  # Each time you import key material into KMS, you can determine whether
  # (`ExpirationModel`) and when (`ValidTo`) the key material expires. To
  # change the expiration of your key material, you must import it again,
  # either by calling `ImportKeyMaterial` or using the [import
  # features](kms/latest/developerguide/importing-keys-import-key-material.html#importing-keys-import-key-material-console)
  # of the KMS console.
  #
  # Before calling `ImportKeyMaterial`:
  #
  # * Create or identify a KMS key with no key material. The KMS key must
  #   have an `Origin` value of `EXTERNAL`, which indicates that the KMS
  #   key is designed for imported key material.
  #
  #   To create an new KMS key for imported key material, call the
  #   CreateKey operation with an `Origin` value of `EXTERNAL`. You can
  #   create a symmetric encryption KMS key, HMAC KMS key, asymmetric
  #   encryption KMS key, or asymmetric signing KMS key. You can also
  #   import key material into a [multi-Region
  #   key](kms/latest/developerguide/multi-region-keys-overview.html) of
  #   any supported type. However, you can't import key material into a
  #   KMS key in a [custom key
  #   store](kms/latest/developerguide/custom-key-store-overview.html).
  #
  # * Use the DescribeKey operation to verify that the `KeyState` of the
  #   KMS key is `PendingImport`, which indicates that the KMS key has no
  #   key material.
  #
  #   If you are reimporting the same key material into an existing KMS
  #   key, you might need to call the DeleteImportedKeyMaterial to delete
  #   its existing key material.
  #
  # * Call the GetParametersForImport operation to get a public key and
  #   import token set for importing key material.
  #
  # * Use the public key in the GetParametersForImport response to encrypt
  #   your key material.
  #
  # Then, in an `ImportKeyMaterial` request, you submit your encrypted key
  # material and import token. When calling this operation, you must
  # specify the following values:
  #
  # * The key ID or key ARN of the KMS key to associate with the imported
  #   key material. Its `Origin` must be `EXTERNAL` and its `KeyState`
  #   must be `PendingImport`. You cannot perform this operation on a KMS
  #   key in a [custom key
  #   store](kms/latest/developerguide/custom-key-store-overview.html), or
  #   on a KMS key in a different Amazon Web Services account. To get the
  #   `Origin` and `KeyState` of a KMS key, call DescribeKey.
  #
  # * The encrypted key material.
  #
  # * The import token that GetParametersForImport returned. You must use
  #   a public key and token from the same `GetParametersForImport`
  #   response.
  #
  # * Whether the key material expires (`ExpirationModel`) and, if so,
  #   when (`ValidTo`). For help with this choice, see [Setting an
  #   expiration time][3] in the *Key Management Service Developer Guide*.
  #
  #   If you set an expiration date, KMS deletes the key material from the
  #   KMS key on the specified date, making the KMS key unusable. To use
  #   the KMS key in cryptographic operations again, you must reimport the
  #   same key material. However, you can delete and reimport the key
  #   material at any time, including before the key material expires.
  #   Each time you reimport, you can eliminate or reset the expiration
  #   time.
  #
  # When this operation is successful, the key state of the KMS key
  # changes from `PendingImport` to `Enabled`, and you can use the KMS key
  # in cryptographic operations.
  #
  # If this operation fails, use the exception to help determine the
  # problem. If the error is related to the key material, the import
  # token, or wrapping key, use GetParametersForImport to get a new public
  # key and import token for the KMS key and repeat the import procedure.
  # For help, see [How To Import Key Material][4] in the *Key Management
  # Service Developer Guide*.
  #
  # The KMS key that you use for this operation must be in a compatible
  # key state. For details, see [Key states of KMS keys][5] in the *Key
  # Management Service Developer Guide*.

  # Decrypts ciphertext and then reencrypts it entirely within KMS. You
  # can use this operation to change the KMS key under which data is
  # encrypted, such as when you [manually rotate][1] a KMS key or change
  # the KMS key that protects a ciphertext. You can also use it to
  # reencrypt ciphertext under the same KMS key, such as to change the
  # [encryption context][2] of a ciphertext.
  #
  # The `ReEncrypt` operation can decrypt ciphertext that was encrypted by
  # using a KMS key in an KMS operation, such as Encrypt or
  # GenerateDataKey. It can also decrypt ciphertext that was encrypted by
  # using the public key of an [asymmetric KMS key][3] outside of KMS.
  # However, it cannot decrypt ciphertext produced by other libraries,
  # such as the [Amazon Web Services Encryption SDK][4] or [Amazon S3
  # client-side encryption][5]. These libraries return a ciphertext format
  # that is incompatible with KMS.
  #
  # When you use the `ReEncrypt` operation, you need to provide
  # information for the decrypt operation and the subsequent encrypt
  # operation.
  #
  # * If your ciphertext was encrypted under an asymmetric KMS key, you
  #   must use the `SourceKeyId` parameter to identify the KMS key that
  #   encrypted the ciphertext. You must also supply the encryption
  #   algorithm that was used. This information is required to decrypt the
  #   data.
  #
  # * If your ciphertext was encrypted under a symmetric encryption KMS
  #   key, the `SourceKeyId` parameter is optional. KMS can get this
  #   information from metadata that it adds to the symmetric ciphertext
  #   blob. This feature adds durability to your implementation by
  #   ensuring that authorized users can decrypt ciphertext decades after
  #   it was encrypted, even if they've lost track of the key ID.
  #   However, specifying the source KMS key is always recommended as a
  #   best practice. When you use the `SourceKeyId` parameter to specify a
  #   KMS key, KMS uses only the KMS key you specify. If the ciphertext
  #   was encrypted under a different KMS key, the `ReEncrypt` operation
  #   fails. This practice ensures that you use the KMS key that you
  #   intend.
  #
  # * To reencrypt the data, you must use the `DestinationKeyId` parameter
  #   to specify the KMS key that re-encrypts the data after it is
  #   decrypted. If the destination KMS key is an asymmetric KMS key, you
  #   must also provide the encryption algorithm. The algorithm that you
  #   choose must be compatible with the KMS key.
  #
  #   When you use an asymmetric KMS key to encrypt or reencrypt data, be
  #   sure to record the KMS key and encryption algorithm that you choose.
  #   You will be required to provide the same KMS key and encryption
  #   algorithm when you decrypt the data. If the KMS key and algorithm do
  #   not match the values used to encrypt the data, the decrypt operation
  #   fails.
  #
  #    You are not required to supply the key ID and encryption algorithm
  #   when you decrypt with symmetric encryption KMS keys because KMS
  #   stores this information in the ciphertext blob. KMS cannot store
  #   metadata in ciphertext generated with asymmetric keys. The standard
  #   format for asymmetric key ciphertext does not include configurable
  #   fields.
  #
  # The KMS key that you use for this operation must be in a compatible
  # key state. For details, see [Key states of KMS keys][6] in the *Key
  # Management Service Developer Guide*.
  #
  # **Cross-account use**: Yes. The source KMS key and destination KMS key
  # can be in different Amazon Web Services accounts. Either or both KMS
  # keys can be in a different account than the caller. To specify a KMS
  # key in a different account, you must use its key ARN or alias ARN.
  #
  # **Required permissions**:
  #
  # * [kms:ReEncryptFrom][7] permission on the source KMS key (key policy)
  #
  # * [kms:ReEncryptTo][7] permission on the destination KMS key (key
  #   policy)
  #
  # To permit reencryption from or to a KMS key, include the
  # `"kms:ReEncrypt*"` permission in your [key policy][8]. This permission
  # is automatically included in the key policy when you use the console
  # to create a KMS key. But you must include it manually when you create
  # a KMS key programmatically or when you use the PutKeyPolicy operation
  # to set a key policy.
  #
  # **Related operations:**
  #
  # * Decrypt
  #
  # * Encrypt
  #
  # * GenerateDataKey

  # Replicates a multi-Region key into the specified Region. This

  # primary key in a different Region of the same Amazon Web Services
  # partition. You can create multiple replicas of a primary key, but each
  # must be in a different Region. To create a multi-Region primary key,
  # use the CreateKey operation.
  #
  # This operation supports *multi-Region keys*, an KMS feature that lets
  # you create multiple interoperable KMS keys in different Amazon Web
  # Services Regions. Because these KMS keys have the same key ID, key
  # material, and other metadata, you can use them interchangeably to
  # encrypt data in one Amazon Web Services Region and decrypt it in a
  # different Amazon Web Services Region without re-encrypting the data or
  # making a cross-Region call. For more information about multi-Region
  # keys, see [Multi-Region keys in KMS][1] in the *Key Management Service
  # Developer Guide*.
  #
  # A *replica key* is a fully-functional KMS key that can be used
  # independently of its primary and peer replica keys. A primary key and
  # its replica keys share properties that make them interoperable. They
  # have the same [key ID][2] and key material. They also have the same
  # [key spec][3], [key usage][4], [key material origin][5], and
  # [automatic key rotation status][6]. KMS automatically synchronizes
  # these shared properties among related multi-Region keys. All other
  # properties of a replica key can differ, including its [key policy][7],
  # [tags][8], [aliases][9], and [Key states of KMS keys][10]. KMS pricing
  # and quotas for KMS keys apply to each primary key and replica key.
  #
  # When this operation completes, the new replica key has a transient key
  # state of `Creating`. This key state changes to `Enabled` (or
  # `PendingImport`) after a few seconds when the process of creating the
  # new replica key is complete. While the key state is `Creating`, you
  # can manage key, but you cannot yet use it in cryptographic operations.
  # If you are creating and using the replica key programmatically, retry
  # on `KMSInvalidStateException` or call `DescribeKey` to check its
  # `KeyState` value before using it. For details about the `Creating` key
  # state, see [Key states of KMS keys][10] in the *Key Management Service
  # Developer Guide*.
  #
  # You cannot create more than one replica of a primary key in any
  # Region. If the Region already includes a replica of the key you're
  # trying to replicate, `ReplicateKey` returns an
  # `AlreadyExistsException` error. If the key state of the existing
  # replica is `PendingDeletion`, you can cancel the scheduled key
  # deletion (CancelKeyDeletion) or wait for the key to be deleted. The
  # new replica key you create will have the same [shared properties][11]
  # as the original replica key.
  #
  # The CloudTrail log of a `ReplicateKey` operation records a
  # `ReplicateKey` operation in the primary key's Region and a CreateKey
  # operation in the replica key's Region.
  #
  # If you replicate a multi-Region primary key with imported key
  # material, the replica key is created with no key material. You must
  # import the same key material that you imported into the primary key.
  # For details, see [Importing key material into multi-Region keys][12]
  # in the *Key Management Service Developer Guide*.
  #
  # To convert a replica key to a primary key, use the UpdatePrimaryRegion
  # operation.
  #
  # <note markdown="1"> `ReplicateKey` uses different default values for the `KeyPolicy` and

  # Schedules the deletion of a KMS key. By default, KMS applies a waiting
  # period of 30 days, but you can specify a waiting period of 7-30 days.
  # When this operation is successful, the key state of the KMS key
  # changes to `PendingDeletion` and the key can't be used in any
  # cryptographic operations. It remains in this state for the duration of
  # the waiting period. Before the waiting period ends, you can use
  # CancelKeyDeletion to cancel the deletion of the KMS key. After the
  # waiting period ends, KMS deletes the KMS key, its key material, and
  # all KMS data associated with it, including all aliases that refer to
  # it.
  #
  # Deleting a KMS key is a destructive and potentially dangerous
  # operation. When a KMS key is deleted, all data that was encrypted
  # under the KMS key is unrecoverable. (The only exception is a
  # [multi-Region replica key][1], or an [asymmetric or HMAC KMS key with
  # imported key
  # material](kms/latest/developerguide/importing-keys-managing.html#import-delete-key).)
  # To prevent the use of a KMS key without deleting it, use DisableKey.
  #
  # You can schedule the deletion of a multi-Region primary key and its
  # replica keys at any time. However, KMS will not delete a multi-Region
  # primary key with existing replica keys. If you schedule the deletion
  # of a primary key with replicas, its key state changes to
  # `PendingReplicaDeletion` and it cannot be replicated or used in
  # cryptographic operations. This status can continue indefinitely. When
  # the last of its replicas keys is deleted (not just scheduled), the key
  # state of the primary key changes to `PendingDeletion` and its waiting
  # period (`PendingWindowInDays`) begins. For details, see [Deleting
  # multi-Region keys][1] in the *Key Management Service Developer Guide*.
  #
  # When KMS [deletes a KMS key from an CloudHSM key store][2], it makes a
  # best effort to delete the associated key material from the associated
  # CloudHSM cluster. However, you might need to manually [delete the
  # orphaned key material][3] from the cluster and its backups. [Deleting
  # a KMS key from an external key store][4] has no effect on the
  # associated external key. However, for both types of custom key stores,
  # deleting a KMS key is destructive and irreversible. You cannot decrypt
  # ciphertext encrypted under the KMS key by using only its associated
  # external key or CloudHSM key. Also, you cannot recreate a KMS key in
  # an external key store by creating a new KMS key with the same key
  # material.

  # Creates a [digital signature][1] for a message or message digest by
  # using the private key in an asymmetric signing KMS key. To verify the
  # signature, use the Verify operation, or use the public key in the same
  # asymmetric KMS key outside of KMS. For information about asymmetric
  # KMS keys, see [Asymmetric KMS keys][2] in the *Key Management Service
  # Developer Guide*.
  #
  # Digital signatures are generated and verified by using asymmetric key
  # pair, such as an RSA or ECC pair that is represented by an asymmetric
  # KMS key. The key owner (or an authorized user) uses their private key
  # to sign a message. Anyone with the public key can verify that the
  # message was signed with that particular private key and that the
  # message hasn't changed since it was signed.
  #
  # To use the `Sign` operation, provide the following information:
  #
  # * Use the `KeyId` parameter to identify an asymmetric KMS key with a
  #   `KeyUsage` value of `SIGN_VERIFY`. To get the `KeyUsage` value of a
  #   KMS key, use the DescribeKey operation. The caller must have
  #   `kms:Sign` permission on the KMS key.
  #
  # * Use the `Message` parameter to specify the message or message digest
  #   to sign. You can submit messages of up to 4096 bytes. To sign a
  #   larger message, generate a hash digest of the message, and then
  #   provide the hash digest in the `Message` parameter. To indicate
  #   whether the message is a full message or a digest, use the
  #   `MessageType` parameter.
  #
  # * Choose a signing algorithm that is compatible with the KMS key.
  #
  # When signing a message, be sure to record the KMS key and the signing
  # algorithm. This information is required to verify the signature.
  #
  # <note markdown="1"> Best practices recommend that you limit the time during which any
  # signature is effective. This deters an attack where the actor uses a
  # signed message to establish validity repeatedly or long after the
  # message is superseded. Signatures do not include a timestamp, but you
  # can include a timestamp in the signed message to help you detect when
  # its time to refresh the signature.
  #
  #  </note>
  #
  # To verify the signature that this operation generates, use the Verify
  # operation. Or use the GetPublicKey operation to download the public
  # key and then use the public key to verify the signature outside of
  # KMS.
  #
  # The KMS key that you use for this operation must be in a compatible
  # key state. For details, see [Key states of KMS keys][3] in the *Key
  # Management Service Developer Guide*.
  #
  # **Cross-account use**: Yes. To perform this operation with a KMS key

  # Changes the properties of a custom key store. You can use this
  # operation to change the properties of an CloudHSM key store or an
  # external key store.
  #
  # Use the required `CustomKeyStoreId` parameter to identify the custom
  # key store. Use the remaining optional parameters to change its
  # properties. This operation does not return any property values. To
  # verify the updated property values, use the DescribeCustomKeyStores
  # operation.
  #
  # This operation is part of the [custom key stores][1] feature in KMS,
  # which combines the convenience and extensive integration of KMS with
  # the isolation and control of a key store that you own and manage.
  #
  # When updating the properties of an external key store, verify that the
  # updated settings connect your key store, via the external key store
  # proxy, to the same external key manager as the previous settings, or
  # to a backup or snapshot of the external key manager with the same
  # cryptographic keys. If the updated connection settings fail, you can
  # fix them and retry, although an extended delay might disrupt Amazon
  # Web Services services. However, if KMS permanently loses its access to
  # cryptographic keys, ciphertext encrypted under those keys is
  # unrecoverable.
  #
  # <note markdown="1"> For external key stores:
  #
  #  Some external key managers provide a simpler method for updating an
  # external key store. For details, see your external key manager
  # documentation.
  #
  #  When updating an external key store in the KMS console, you can upload
  # a JSON-based proxy configuration file with the desired values. You
  # cannot upload the proxy configuration file to the
  # `UpdateCustomKeyStore` operation. However, you can use the file to
  # help you determine the correct values for the `UpdateCustomKeyStore`
  # parameters.
  #
  #  </note>
  #
  # For an CloudHSM key store, you can use this operation to change the
  # custom key store friendly name (`NewCustomKeyStoreName`), to tell KMS
  # about a change to the `kmsuser` crypto user password
  # (`KeyStorePassword`), or to associate the custom key store with a
  # different, but related, CloudHSM cluster (`CloudHsmClusterId`). To
  # update any property of an CloudHSM key store, the `ConnectionState` of
  # the CloudHSM key store must be `DISCONNECTED`.
  #
  # For an external key store, you can use this operation to change the
  # custom key store friendly name (`NewCustomKeyStoreName`), or to tell
  # KMS about a change to the external key store proxy authentication
  # credentials (`XksProxyAuthenticationCredential`), connection method
  # (`XksProxyConnectivity`), external proxy endpoint
  # (`XksProxyUriEndpoint`) and path (`XksProxyUriPath`). For external key
  # stores with an `XksProxyConnectivity` of `VPC_ENDPOINT_SERVICE`, you
  # can also update the Amazon VPC endpoint service name
  # (`XksProxyVpcEndpointServiceName`). To update most properties of an
  # external key store, the `ConnectionState` of the external key store
  # must be `DISCONNECTED`. However, you can update the
  # `CustomKeyStoreName`, `XksProxyAuthenticationCredential`, and
  # `XksProxyUriPath` of an external key store when it is in the CONNECTED
  # or DISCONNECTED state.
  #
  # If your update requires a `DISCONNECTED` state, before using
  # `UpdateCustomKeyStore`, use the DisconnectCustomKeyStore operation to
  # disconnect the custom key store. After the `UpdateCustomKeyStore`
  # operation completes, use the ConnectCustomKeyStore to reconnect the
  # custom key store. To find the `ConnectionState` of the custom key
  # store, use the DescribeCustomKeyStores operation.
  #
  #
  #
  # Before updating the custom key store, verify that the new values allow
  # KMS to connect the custom key store to its backing key store. For
  # example, before you change the `XksProxyUriPath` value, verify that
  # the external key store proxy is reachable at the new path.
  #
  # If the operation succeeds, it returns a JSON object with no
  # properties.
  #
  # **Cross-account use**: No. You cannot perform this operation on a
  # custom key store in a different Amazon Web Services account.

  # Changes the primary key of a multi-Region key.
  #
  # This operation changes the replica key in the specified Region to a
  # primary key and changes the former primary key to a replica key. For
  # example, suppose you have a primary key in `us-east-1` and a replica
  # key in `eu-west-2`. If you run `UpdatePrimaryRegion` with a
  # `PrimaryRegion` value of `eu-west-2`, the primary key is now the key
  # in `eu-west-2`, and the key in `us-east-1` becomes a replica key. For
  # details, see [Updating the primary Region][1] in the *Key Management
  # Service Developer Guide*.
  #
  # This operation supports *multi-Region keys*, an KMS feature that lets
  # you create multiple interoperable KMS keys in different Amazon Web
  # Services Regions. Because these KMS keys have the same key ID, key
  # material, and other metadata, you can use them interchangeably to
  # encrypt data in one Amazon Web Services Region and decrypt it in a
  # different Amazon Web Services Region without re-encrypting the data or
  # making a cross-Region call. For more information about multi-Region
  # keys, see [Multi-Region keys in KMS][2] in the *Key Management Service
  # Developer Guide*.
  #
  # The *primary key* of a multi-Region key is the source for properties
  # that are always shared by primary and replica keys, including the key
  # material, [key ID][3], [key spec][4], [key usage][5], [key material
  # origin][6], and [automatic key rotation][7]. It's the only key that
  # can be replicated. You cannot [delete the primary key][8] until all
  # replica keys are deleted.
  #
  # The key ID and primary Region that you specify uniquely identify the
  # replica key that will become the primary key. The primary Region must
  # already have a replica key. This operation does not create a KMS key

  #
  # You can run this operation while using the affected multi-Region keys
  # in cryptographic operations. This operation should not delay,
  # interrupt, or cause failures in cryptographic operations.
  #
  # Even after this operation completes, the process of updating the

  # Operations such as `DescribeKey` might display both the old and new
  # primary keys as replicas. The old and new primary keys have a
  # transient key state of `Updating`. The original key state is restored
  # when the update is complete. While the key state is `Updating`, you
  # can use the keys in cryptographic operations, but you cannot replicate
  # the new primary key or perform certain management operations, such as
  # enabling or disabling these keys. For details about the `Updating` key
  # state, see [Key states of KMS keys][9] in the *Key Management Service

  # Verifies a digital signature that was generated by the Sign operation.
  #
  #
  #
  # Verification confirms that an authorized user signed the message with
  # the specified KMS key and signing algorithm, and the message hasn't
  # changed since it was signed. If the signature is verified, the value
  # of the `SignatureValid` field in the response is `True`. If the
  # signature verification fails, the `Verify` operation fails with an
  # `KMSInvalidSignatureException` exception.
  #
  # A digital signature is generated by using the private key in an
  # asymmetric KMS key. The signature is verified by using the public key
  # in the same asymmetric KMS key. For information about asymmetric KMS
  # keys, see [Asymmetric KMS keys][1] in the *Key Management Service
  # Developer Guide*.
  #
  # To use the `Verify` operation, specify the same asymmetric KMS key,
  # message, and signing algorithm that were used to produce the
  # signature. The message type does not need to be the same as the one
  # used for signing, but it must indicate whether the value of the
  # `Message` parameter should be hashed as part of the verification
  # process.
  #
  # You can also verify the digital signature by using the public key of
  # the KMS key outside of KMS. Use the GetPublicKey operation to download
  # the public key in the asymmetric KMS key and then use the public key
  # to verify the signature outside of KMS. The advantage of using the
  # `Verify` operation is that it is performed within KMS. As a result,
  # it's easy to call, the operation is performed within the FIPS
  # boundary, it is logged in CloudTrail, and you can use key policy and
  # IAM policy to determine who is authorized to use the KMS key to verify
  # signatures.
  #
  # To verify a signature outside of KMS with an SM2 public key (China
  # Regions only), you must specify the distinguishing ID. By default, KMS
  # uses `1234567812345678` as the distinguishing ID. For more
  # information, see [Offline verification with SM2 key pairs][2].
  #
  # The KMS key that you use for this operation must be in a compatible
  # key state. For details, see [Key states of KMS keys][3] in the *Key
  # Management Service Developer Guide*.
  #
  # **Cross-account use**: Yes. To perform this operation with a KMS key
  # in a different Amazon Web Services account, specify the key ARN or
  # alias ARN in the value of the `KeyId` parameter.
  #
  # **Required permissions**: [kms:Verify][4] (key policy)

# When KMS returns an error response, the Ruby SDK constructs and raises an error.
# These errors all extend Aws::KMS::Errors::ServiceError < {Aws::Errors::ServiceError}
#
# You can rescue all KMS errors using ServiceError:
#
#     begin
#       # do stuff
#     rescue Aws::KMS::Errors::ServiceError
#       # rescues all KMS API errors
#     end
#
#
# ## Request Context
# ServiceError objects have a {Aws::Errors::ServiceError#context #context} method that returns
# information about the request that generated the error.
# See {Seahorse::Client::RequestContext} for more information.
#

# The request was rejected because the associated CloudHSM cluster did
# not meet the configuration requirements for an CloudHSM key store.
#
# * The CloudHSM cluster must be configured with private subnets in at
#   least two different Availability Zones in the Region.
#
# * The [security group for the cluster][1]
#   (cloudhsm-cluster-*&lt;cluster-id&gt;*-sg) must include inbound
#   rules and outbound rules that allow TCP traffic on ports 2223-2225.
#   The **Source** in the inbound rules and the **Destination** in the
#   outbound rules must match the security group ID. These rules are set
#   by default when you create the CloudHSM cluster. Do not delete or
#   change them. To get information about a particular security group,
#   use the [DescribeSecurityGroups][2] operation.
#
# * The CloudHSM cluster must contain at least as many HSMs as the
#   operation requires. To add HSMs, use the CloudHSM [CreateHsm][3]
#   operation.
#
#   For the CreateCustomKeyStore, UpdateCustomKeyStore, and CreateKey
#   operations, the CloudHSM cluster must have at least two active HSMs,
#   each in a different Availability Zone. For the ConnectCustomKeyStore
#   operation, the CloudHSM must contain at least one active HSM.
#
# For information about the requirements for an CloudHSM cluster that is

# Use this structure to allow [cryptographic operations][1] in the grant
# only when the operation request includes the specified [encryption
# context][2].
#
# KMS applies the grant constraints only to cryptographic operations
# that support an encryption context, that is, all cryptographic
# operations with a [symmetric KMS key][3]. Grant constraints are not
# applied to operations that do not support an encryption context, such
# as cryptographic operations with asymmetric KMS keys and management
# operations, such as DescribeKey or RetireGrant.
#
# In a cryptographic operation, the encryption context in the decryption
# operation must be an exact, case-sensitive match for the keys and
# values in the encryption context of the encryption operation. Only the
# order of the pairs can vary.
#
#  However, in a grant constraint, the key in each key-value pair is not
# case sensitive, but the value is case sensitive.
#
#  To avoid confusion, do not use multiple encryption context pairs that
# differ only by case. To require a fully case-sensitive encryption
# context, use the `kms:EncryptionContext:` and
# `kms:EncryptionContextKeys` conditions in an IAM or key policy. For
# details, see [kms:EncryptionContext:][4] in the <i> <i>Key Management
# Service Developer Guide</i> </i>.
