## Context 🕵️‍♀️

> Provide information that helps with understanding your issue. For example your use case that the project doesn't cover, what you were doing when you found the bug... You can also provide the version that you were using, how you integrated it with your project, the platform version...

## What 🌱

> Describe here your issue, a bug you found, an idea that you had, or something that you think can be improved. If it's a bug, it's necessary to add a reference to a [reproducible test case](https://docs.tuist.io/contribution-tuist#set-up-the-project-locally) that helps us isolate the cause of the problem.

## Proposal 🎉

> Attach your own proposal _(if you have it)_. We'll discuss in on the issue to find the best one that fits into the library.
