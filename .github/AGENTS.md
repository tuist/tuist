# GitHub automation

Workflows live in `workflows/`, reusable actions in `actions/`, and supporting
scripts in `scripts/`. Changes to privileged workflows must keep contributor
content separate from executable code.

Stable cache certificate readiness is an operator bootstrap check documented in
`infra/cache-dns/README.md`, not a gate on routine server deployments. The Kura
controller verifies TLS before advertising stable endpoints.

The runners-controller release publishes both the controller and cache-volume
agent under the same version. Its release tag requires both images to exist;
managed production selects that agent version and provisions host cache storage
through Helm, without a separate human kubectl elevation.

## Community notifications

`workflows/community-notifications.yml` sends new community issues and PRs to
Slack. Filtering and payload construction live in
`scripts/community-notifications.cjs`; setup and operational limitations are
documented in `COMMUNITY_NOTIFICATIONS.md`.

- Exclude `company` and `external` team members, GitHub bots, and explicitly
  listed legacy automation accounts. Do not use repository association as an
  employment signal.
- Membership lookup errors must fail visibly, not produce staff notifications.
- The privileged PR workflow must only check out trusted event code, never a
  PR head or merge ref. Keep contributor text in plain-text Slack blocks.
- Validate changes with `node --test scripts/community-notifications.test.cjs`
  from this directory and `actionlint workflows/community-notifications.yml`.

Cache-volume distribution recovery uses the original immutable source commit from
a partial release; finish that version before dispatching a release of newer main
changes. Never substitute new contents beneath an existing distribution tag.

Linux Gradle tests and runner-controller tests use the released `tuist/cache-volume@v1`
action with stable keys and isolated paths outside checkout. Gradle uses one
home volume mounted at GRADLE_USER_HOME. Disable archive
caching for those same paths; keep Go test result reuse disabled with `-count=1`.

## Tuist Elixir package

`tuist-ex.yml` runs separate compilation, documentation, test, formatting,
and package jobs. Compilation covers the minimum and current supported Elixir
versions. The workflow is reused by `tuist-ex-release.yml` before publication.
Releases run only from `main`, serialize publishing, and use the shared
`release:check` registry with the `tuist-ex@` tag prefix. The existing
`HEX_API_KEY` secret used by Noora must be able to publish `tuist_ex`.

## Bazel and Mix cache volumes

Kura's `.bazelrc` configures repository downloads and disk action caching under
`~/.cache/tuist/bazel` on Linux, not its output base or remote credentials. CI
attaches that directory with the released action. Keep Tuist remote cache setup
in trusted jobs. Idle disk-cache GC has a 12 GiB target and seven-day age limit;
this is a soft cleanup target within the 20 GB volume, not a build-time quota.

Mix jobs attach their ordinary `deps` and `_build` directories with separate
readable project/job keys. Mix owns compiler and dependency invalidation; do not
add lockfile-hash keys, compatibility-marker scripts or physical-path rewrites.
Always run dependency resolution and compilation on hits. Never retain ~/.hex
or authentication configuration. Preserve setup-server-mix's explicit
restore-mix-cache=false callers. Do not add volume-specific composite wrappers.
