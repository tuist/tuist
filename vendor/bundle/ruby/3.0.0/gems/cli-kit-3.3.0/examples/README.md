# Examples

**Note: If you're looking to bootstrap a new app, consider running `cli-kit new` instead of
copy/pasting one of these.**

## Full Example

The full example lives in its own repository at https://github.com/Shopify/cli-kit-example.
This is quite similar to the output of `cli-kit new`, but fleshed out a little bit more with
a couple of commands.

## Single-File starting point

Maybe it appeals to you to start from a single file and grow, rather than generating framework.
Check out the [`examples/single-file`](single-file) example.

## Minimal example

This example demonstrates the core of what `cli-kit` does very simply, but in general, shouldn't be
used for anything other than quick hacks. It leaves out a few best practices that help CLI apps
scale gracefully. Find it at [`examples/minimal`](minimal).
