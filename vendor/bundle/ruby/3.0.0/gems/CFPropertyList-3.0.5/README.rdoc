CFPropertyList implementation
class to read, manipulate and write both XML and binary property list
files (plist(5)) as defined by Apple. Have a look at CFPropertyList::List
for more documentation.

== Installation

You could either use ruby gems and install it via

  gem install CFPropertyList

or you could clone this repository and place it somewhere in your load path.

== Example
  require 'cfpropertylist'

  # create a arbitrary data structure of basic data types
  data = {
    'name' => 'John Doe',
    'missing' => true,
    'last_seen' => Time.now,
    'friends' => ['Jane Doe','Julian Doe'],
    'likes' => {
      'me' => false
    }
  }

  # create CFPropertyList::List object
  plist = CFPropertyList::List.new

  # call CFPropertyList.guess() to create corresponding CFType values
  plist.value = CFPropertyList.guess(data)

  # write plist to file
  plist.save("example.plist", CFPropertyList::List::FORMAT_BINARY)

  # â€¦ later, read it again
  plist = CFPropertyList::List.new(:file => "example.plist")
  data = CFPropertyList.native_types(plist.value)
