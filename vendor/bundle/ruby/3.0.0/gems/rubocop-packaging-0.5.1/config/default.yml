Packaging/BundlerSetupInTests:
  Description: >-
                 Using `bundler/setup` in tests is redundant. Consider
                 removing it.

Packaging/GemspecGit:
  Description: >-
                 Avoid using git to produce lists of files. Downstreams
                 often need to build your package in an environment
                 that does not have git (on purpose). Use some pure
                 Ruby alternative, like `Dir` or `Dir.glob`.

Packaging/RequireHardcodingLib:
  Description: >-
                 Avoid using `require` with relative path to lib. Use
                 `require` with absolute path instead.
  Enabled: true

Packaging/RequireRelativeHardcodingLib:
  Description: >-
                 Avoid using `require_relative` with relative path to
                 lib. Use `require` with absolute path instead.
