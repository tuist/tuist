# Contributing

I love accepting issues and pull requests. I only ask for a few guidelines to
be followed that will make it much easier for me to solve your issue or get
your code merged.

1. Use GitHub Issues or Pull Requests over sending an email. It's much easier for me to keep track of your issue through GitHub.
2. For __compiler issues__, please provide both a gist for the __source definition(s)__ as well as the __generated output__ (if any).
3. For __existing issues or functionality__, please use the latest stable branch (currently __`3-5-stable`__) as the base branch for the pull request. This helps us maintain a stable gem release strategy. All commits merged to stable will also be merged down to `master`.
4. For __new functionality__, please use __`master`__ as the base branch for the pull request. The `master` branch is used to stage all "next iteration" work.
5. Be patient with me as I work on your issue.

Following these simple guidelines really will help me help you. And really,
that's what we're here for. I'm on @localshred on twitter, let's be friends. :)

## Happy Contributing!
