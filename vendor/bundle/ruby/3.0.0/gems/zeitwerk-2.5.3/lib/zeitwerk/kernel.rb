  # We are going to decorate Kernel#require with two goals.
  #
  # First, by intercepting Kernel#require calls, we are able to autovivify
  # modules on required directories, and also do internal housekeeping when
  # managed files are loaded.
  #
  # On the other hand, if you publish a new version of a gem that is now managed
  # by Zeitwerk, client code can reference directly your classes and modules and
  # should not require anything. But if someone has legacy require calls around,
  # they will work as expected, and in a compatible way. This feature is by now
  # EXPERIMENTAL and UNDOCUMENTED.
  #
  # We cannot decorate with prepend + super because Kernel has already been
  # included in Object, and changes in ancestors don't get propagated into
  # already existing ancestor chains.

  # By now, I have seen no way so far to decorate require_relative.
  #
  # For starters, at least in CRuby, require_relative does not delegate to
  # require. Both require and require_relative delegate the bulk of their work
  # to an internal C function called rb_require_safe. So, our require wrapper is
  # not executed.
  #
  # On the other hand, we cannot use the aliasing technique above because
  # require_relative receives a path relative to the directory of the file in
  # which the call is performed. If a wrapper here invoked the original method,
  # Ruby would resolve the relative path taking lib/zeitwerk as base directory.
  #
  # A workaround could be to extract the base directory from caller_locations,
  # but what if someone else decorated require_relative before us? You can't
  # really know with certainty where's the original call site in the stack.
  #
  # However, the main use case for require_relative is to load files from your
  # own project. Projects managed by Zeitwerk don't do this for files managed by
  # Zeitwerk, precisely.
