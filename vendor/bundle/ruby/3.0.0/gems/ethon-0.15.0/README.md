#  Ethon

In Greek mythology, Ethon, the son of Typhoeus and Echidna, is a gigantic eagle. So much for the history.
In the modern world, Ethon is a very basic libcurl wrapper using ffi.

## Installation

With bundler:

    gem "ethon"

With rubygems:

    gem install ethon

## Usage

Making the first request is simple:

```ruby
easy = Ethon::Easy.new(url: "www.example.com")
easy.perform
#=> :ok
```

You have access to various options, such as following redirects:

```ruby
easy = Ethon::Easy.new(url: "www.example.com", followlocation: true)
easy.perform
#=> :ok
```

Once you're done you can inspect the response code and body:

```ruby
easy = Ethon::Easy.new(url: "www.example.com", followlocation: true)
easy.perform
easy.response_code
#=> 200
easy.response_body
#=> "<!doctype html><html ..."
```

## Http

In order to make life easier, there are some helpers for making HTTP requests:

```ruby
easy = Ethon::Easy.new
easy.http_request("www.example.com", :get, { params: {a: 1} })
easy.perform
#=> :ok
```

```ruby
easy = Ethon::Easy.new
easy.http_request("www.example.com", :post, { params: { a: 1 }, body: { b: 2 } })
easy.perform
#=> :ok
```

This is really handy when making requests since you don't have to care about setting
everything up correctly.
