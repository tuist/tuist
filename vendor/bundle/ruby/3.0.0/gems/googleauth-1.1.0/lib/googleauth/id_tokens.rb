    ##
    # ## Verifying Google ID tokens
    #
    # This module verifies ID tokens issued by Google. This can be used to
    # authenticate signed-in users using OpenID Connect. See
    # https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/web/backend-auth for more
    # information.
    #
    # ### Basic usage
    #
    # To verify an ID token issued by Google accounts:
    #
    #     payload = Google::Auth::IDTokens.verify_oidc the_token,
    #                                                  aud: "my-app-client-id"
    #
    # If verification succeeds, you will receive the token's payload as a hash.
    # If verification fails, an exception (normally a subclass of
    # {Google::Auth::IDTokens::VerificationError}) will be raised.
    #
    # To verify an ID token issued by the Google identity-aware proxy (IAP):
    #
    #     payload = Google::Auth::IDTokens.verify_iap the_token,
    #                                                 aud: "my-app-client-id"
    #
    # These methods will automatically download and cache the Google public
    # keys necessary to verify these tokens. They will also automatically
    # verify the issuer (`iss`) field for their respective types of ID tokens.
    #
    # ### Advanced usage
    #
    # If you want to provide your own public keys, either by pointing at a
    # custom URI or by providing the key data directly, use the Verifier class
    # and pass in a key source.
    #
    # To point to a custom URI that returns a JWK set:
    #
    #     source = Google::Auth::IDTokens::JwkHttpKeySource.new "https://example.com/jwk"
    #     verifier = Google::Auth::IDTokens::Verifier.new key_source: source
    #     payload = verifier.verify the_token, aud: "my-app-client-id"
    #
    # To provide key data directly:
    #
    #     jwk_data = {
    #       keys: [
    #         {
    #           alg: "ES256",
    #           crv: "P-256",
    #           kid: "LYyP2g",
    #           kty: "EC",
    #           use: "sig",
    #           x: "SlXFFkJ3JxMsXyXNrqzE3ozl_0913PmNbccLLWfeQFU",
    #           y: "GLSahrZfBErmMUcHP0MGaeVnJdBwquhrhQ8eP05NfCI"
    #         }
    #       ]
    #     }
    #     source = Google::Auth::IDTokens::StaticKeySource.from_jwk_set jwk_data
    #     verifier = Google::Auth::IDTokens::Verifier key_source: source
    #     payload = verifier.verify the_token, aud: "my-app-client-id"
