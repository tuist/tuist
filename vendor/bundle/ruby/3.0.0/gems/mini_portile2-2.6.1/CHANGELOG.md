## mini_portile changelog

### 2.6.1 / 2021-05-31

#### Dependencies

Make `net-ftp` an optional dependency, since requiring it as a hard dependency in v2.5.2 caused warnings to be emitted by Ruby 2.7 and earlier. A warning message is emitted if FTP functionality is called and `net-ftp` isn't available; this should only happen in Ruby 3.1 and later.


### 2.5.3 / 2021-05-31

#### Dependencies

Make `net-ftp` an optional dependency, since requiring it as a hard dependency in v2.5.2 caused warnings to be emitted by Ruby 2.7 and earlier. A warning message is emitted if FTP functionality is called and `net-ftp` isn't available; this should only happen in Ruby 3.1 and later.


### 2.6.0 / 2021-05-31

### Added

Recipes may build against a local directory by specifying `source_directory` instead of `files`. In
particular, this may be useful for debugging problems with the upstream dependency (e.g., use `git
bisect` in a local clone) or for continuous integration with upstream HEAD.


### 2.5.2 / 2021-05-28

#### Dependencies

Add `net-ftp` as an explicit dependency to accommodate the upcoming Ruby 3.1 changes that move this and other gems out of the "default" gem set and into the "bundled" gem set. See https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/17873 [#101]


### 2.5.1 / 2021-04-28

#### Dependencies

This release ends support for ruby < 2.3.0. If you're on 2.2.x or earlier, we strongly suggest that you find the time to upgrade, because [official support for Ruby 2.2 ended on 2018-03-31](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2018/06/20/support-of-ruby-2-2-has-ended/).

#### Enhancements

* `MiniPortile.execute` now takes an optional `:env` hash, which is merged into the environment variables for the subprocess. Likely this is only useful for specialized use cases. [#99]
* Experimental support for cmake-based projects extended to Windows. (Thanks, @larskanis!)


### 2.5.0 / 2020-02-24

#### Enhancements

* When verifying GPG signatures, remove all imported pubkeys from keyring [#90] (Thanks, @hanazuki!)
    

### 2.4.0 / 2018-12-02

#### Enhancements

* Skip progress report when Content-Length is unavailable. [#85] (Thanks, @eagletmt!)


### 2.3.0 / 2017-09-13

#### Enhancements

* Verify checksums of files at extraction time (in addition to at download time). (#56)
* Clarify error message if a `tar` command can't be found. (#81)


### 2.2.0 / 2017-06-04

#### Enhancements

* Remove MD5 hashing of configure options, not avialbale in FIPS mode. (#78)
* Add experimental support for cmake-based projects.
* Retry on HTTP failures during downloads. [#63] (Thanks, @jtarchie and @jvshahid!)
* Support Ruby 2.4 frozen string literals.
* Support applying patches for users with misconfigured git worktree. [#69]
* Support gpg signature verification of download resources.


### 2.1.0 / 2016-01-06

#### Enhancements

* Add support for `file:` protocol for tarballs


#### Bugfixes

* Raise exception on unsupported URI protocols
* Ignore git whitespace config when patching (Thanks, @e2!) (#67)


### 2.0.0 / 2015-11-30

Many thanks to @larskanis, @knu, and @kirikak2, who all contributed
code, ideas, or both to this release.

Note that the 0.7.0.rc* series was not released as 0.7.0 final, and
instead became 2.0.0 due to backwards-incompatible behavioral changes
which can appear because rubygems doesn't enforce loading the declared
dependency version at installation-time (only run-time).

If you use MiniPortile in an `extconf.rb` file, please make sure you're
setting a gem version constraint before `require "mini_portile2"` .

Note also that 2.0.0 doesn't include the backwards-compatible "escaped
string" behavior from 0.7.0.rc3.


#### Enhancements

* In patch task, use git(1) or patch(1), whichever is available.
* Append outputs to patch.log instead of clobbering it for every patch command.
* Take `configure_options` literally without running a subshell.
  This changes allows for embedded spaces in a path, among other things.
  Please unescape `configure_options` where you have been doing it yourself.
* Print last 20 lines of the given log file, for convenience.
* Allow SHA1, SHA256 and MD5 hash verification of downloads


#### Bugfixes

* Fix issue when proxy username/password use escaped characters.
* Fix use of https and ftp proxy.


### 0.7.0.rc4 / 2015-08-24

* Updated tests for Windows. No functional change. Final release candidate?


### 0.7.0.rc3 / 2015-08-24

* Restore backwards-compatible behavior with respect to escaped strings.


### 0.7.0.rc2 / 2015-08-24

* Restore support for Ruby 1.9.2
* Add Ruby 2.0.0 and Ruby 2.1.x to Appveyor suite


### 0.7.0.rc1 / 2015-08-24
