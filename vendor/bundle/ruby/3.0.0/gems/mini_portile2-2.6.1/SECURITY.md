# Security and Vulnerability Reporting

The mini_portile core contributors take security very seriously and investigate all reported vulnerabilities.

If you would like to report a vulnerablity or have a security concern regarding mini_portile, please [report it via Tidelift](https://tidelift.com/security).

Your report will be acknowledged within 48 hours, and you'll receive a more detailed response within 96 hours indicating next steps in handling your report.

If you have not received a reply to your submission within 96 hours, Contact the current security coordinator, Mike Dalessio <mike.dalessio@gmail.com>.

The information you share with the mini_portile core contributors as part of this process will be kept confidential within the team, unless or until we need to share information upstream with our dependent libraries' core teams, at which point we will notify you.

If a vulnerability is first reported by you, we will credit you with the discovery in the public disclosure.
