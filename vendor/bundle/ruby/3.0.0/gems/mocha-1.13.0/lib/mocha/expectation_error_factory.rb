  # This factory determines what class of exception should be raised when Mocha detects a test failure.
  #
  # This class should only be used by authors of test libraries and not by typical "users" of Mocha.
  #
  # For example, it is used by +Mocha::Integration::MiniTest::Adapter+ in order to have Mocha raise a +MiniTest::Assertion+ which can then be sensibly handled by +MiniTest::Unit::TestCase+.

      #   Determines what class of exception should be raised when Mocha detects a test failure.
      #
      #   This attribute may be set by authors of test libraries in order to have Mocha raise exceptions of a specific class when there is an unexpected invocation or an unsatisfied expectation.
      #
      #   By default a +Mocha::ExpectationError+ will be raised.
