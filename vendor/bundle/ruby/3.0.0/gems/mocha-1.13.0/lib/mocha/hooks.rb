module Mocha
  # Integration hooks for test library authors.
  #
  # The methods in this module should be called from test libraries wishing to integrate with Mocha.
  #
  # This module is provided as part of the +Mocha::API+ module and is therefore part of the public API, but should only be used by authors of test libraries and not by typical "users" of Mocha.
  #
  # Integration with Test::Unit and MiniTest are provided as part of Mocha, because they are (or were once) part of the Ruby standard library. Integration with other test libraries is not provided as *part* of Mocha, but is supported by means of the methods in this module.
  #
  # See the code in the +Adapter+ modules for examples of how to use the methods in this module. +Mocha::ExpectationErrorFactory+ may be used if you want +Mocha+ to raise a different type of exception.
