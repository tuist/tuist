    #   The passed Proc will be invoked at GC time (SEE WARNING BELOW!)
    #   @note WARNING: passing a proc _may_ cause your pointer to never be

    #     pointer in the proc. See the test specs for examples.

    #   @param pointer [Pointer]

    #   @note
    #     WARNING: passing a block will cause your pointer to never be GC'd.
    #     This is bad.
    # @overload initialize(pointer)
    #   @param pointer [Pointer]
    #   @return [self]
    #   The pointer's release() class method will be invoked at GC time.
    #
    # @note The safest, and therefore preferred, calling
    #  idiom is to pass a Method as the second parameter. Example usage:
    #
    #   class PointerHelper
    #     def self.release(pointer)
    #       ...
    #     end
    #   end
    #
    #   p = AutoPointer.new(other_pointer, PointerHelper.method(:release))
    #
    #  The above code will cause PointerHelper#release to be invoked at GC time.
    #
    # @note
    #  The last calling idiom (only one parameter) is generally only
    #  going to be useful if you subclass {AutoPointer}, and override
    #  #release, which by default does nothing.
