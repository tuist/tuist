# Typhoeus [![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/travis/typhoeus/typhoeus/master.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/typhoeus/typhoeus) [![Code Climate](https://img.shields.io/codeclimate/maintainability/typhoeus/typhoeus.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/typhoeus/typhoeus) [![Gem Version](https://img.shields.io/gem/v/typhoeus.svg)](https://rubygems.org/gems/typhoeus)

Like a modern code version of the mythical beast with 100 serpent heads, Typhoeus runs HTTP requests in parallel while cleanly encapsulating handling logic.

## Example

A single request:

```ruby
Typhoeus.get("www.example.com", followlocation: true)
```

Parallel requests:

```ruby
hydra = Typhoeus::Hydra.new
10.times.map{ hydra.queue(Typhoeus::Request.new("www.example.com", followlocation: true)) }
hydra.run
```

## Installation
Add the following line to your Gemfile:
```
gem "typhoeus"
```
Then run `bundle install`

Or install it yourself as:

```
gem install typhoeus
```

## Usage

### Introduction

The primary interface for Typhoeus is comprised of three classes: Request, Response, and Hydra. Request represents an HTTP request object, response represents an HTTP response, and Hydra manages making parallel HTTP connections.

```ruby
request = Typhoeus::Request.new(
  "www.example.com",
  method: :post,
  body: "this is a request body",
  params: { field1: "a field" },
  headers: { Accept: "text/html" }
)
```

We can see from this that the first argument is the url. The second is a set of options.
The options are all optional. The default for `:method` is `:get`.

When you want to send URL parameters, you can use `:params` hash to do so. Please note that in case of you should send a request via `x-www-form-urlencoded` parameters, you need to use `:body` hash instead. `params` are for URL parameters and `:body` is for the request body.

#### Sending requests through the proxy

Add a proxy url to the list of options:

```ruby
options = {proxy: 'http://myproxy.org'}
req = Typhoeus::Request.new(url, options)
```

If your proxy requires authentication, add it with `proxyuserpwd` option key:

```ruby
options = {proxy: 'http://proxyurl.com', proxyuserpwd: 'user:password'}
req = Typhoeus::Request.new(url, options)
```

Note that `proxyuserpwd` is a colon-separated username and password, in the vein of basic auth `userpwd` option.


You can run the query either on its own or through the hydra:

``` ruby
request.run
#=> <Typhoeus::Response ... >
```

```ruby
hydra = Typhoeus::Hydra.hydra
hydra.queue(request)
hydra.run
```

The response object will be set after the request is run.

```ruby
response = request.response
response.code
response.total_time
response.headers
response.body
```

### Making Quick Requests

Typhoeus has some convenience methods for performing single HTTP requests. The arguments are the same as those you pass into the request constructor.

```ruby
Typhoeus.get("www.example.com")
Typhoeus.head("www.example.com")
Typhoeus.put("www.example.com/posts/1", body: "whoo, a body")
Typhoeus.patch("www.example.com/posts/1", body: "a new body")
Typhoeus.post("www.example.com/posts", body: { title: "test post", content: "this is my test"})
Typhoeus.delete("www.example.com/posts/1")
Typhoeus.options("www.example.com")
```
#### Sending params in the body with PUT
When using POST the content-type is set automatically to 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'. That's not the case for any other method like PUT, PATCH, HEAD and so on,  irrespective of whether you are using body or not. To get the same result as POST, i.e. a hash in the body coming through as params in the receiver, you need to set the content-type as shown below:
```ruby
Typhoeus.put("www.example.com/posts/1",
        headers: {'Content-Type'=> "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"},
        body: {title:"test post updated title", content: "this is my updated content"}
    )
```

### Handling HTTP errors

You can query the response object to figure out if you had a successful
request or not. Hereâ€™s some example code that you might use to handle errors.
The callbacks are executed right after the request is finished, make sure to define
them before running the request.

```ruby
request = Typhoeus::Request.new("www.example.com", followlocation: true)

request.on_complete do |response|
  if response.success?
    # hell yeah
  elsif response.timed_out?
    # aw hell no
    log("got a time out")
  elsif response.code == 0
    # Could not get an http response, something's wrong.
    log(response.return_message)
  else
    # Received a non-successful http response.
    log("HTTP request failed: " + response.code.to_s)
  end
end

request.run
```

This also works with serial (blocking) requests in the same fashion. Both
serial and parallel requests return a Response object.

### Handling file uploads

A File object can be passed as a param for a POST request to handle uploading
files to the server. Typhoeus will upload the file as the original file name
and use Mime::Types to set the content type.

```ruby
Typhoeus.post(
  "http://localhost:3000/posts",
  body: {
    title: "test post",
    content: "this is my test",
    file: File.open("thesis.txt","r")
  }
)
```

### Streaming the response body

Typhoeus can stream responses. When you're expecting a large response,
set the `on_body` callback on a request. Typhoeus will yield to the callback
with chunks of the response, as they're read. When you set an `on_body` callback,
Typhoeus will not store the complete response.

```ruby
downloaded_file = File.open 'huge.iso', 'wb'
request = Typhoeus::Request.new("www.example.com/huge.iso")
request.on_headers do |response|
  if response.code != 200
    raise "Request failed"
  end
end
request.on_body do |chunk|
  downloaded_file.write(chunk)
end
request.on_complete do |response|
  downloaded_file.close
  # Note that response.body is ""
end
request.run
```

If you need to interrupt the stream halfway,
you can return the `:abort` symbol from the `on_body` block, example:

```ruby
request.on_body do |chunk|
  buffer << chunk
  :abort if buffer.size > 1024 * 1024
end
```

This will properly stop the stream internally and avoid any memory leak which
may happen if you interrupt with something like a `return`, `throw` or `raise`.

### Making Parallel Requests

Generally, you should be running requests through hydra. Here is how that looks:

```ruby
hydra = Typhoeus::Hydra.hydra

first_request = Typhoeus::Request.new("http://example.com/posts/1")
first_request.on_complete do |response|
  third_url = response.body
  third_request = Typhoeus::Request.new(third_url)
  hydra.queue third_request
end
second_request = Typhoeus::Request.new("http://example.com/posts/2")

hydra.queue first_request
hydra.queue second_request
hydra.run # this is a blocking call that returns once all requests are complete
```

The execution of that code goes something like this. The first and second requests are built and queued. When hydra is run the first and second requests run in parallel. When the first request completes, the third request is then built and queued, in this example based on the result of the first request. The moment it is queued Hydra starts executing it.  Meanwhile the second request would continue to run (or it could have completed before the first). Once the third request is done, `hydra.run` returns.

How to get an array of response bodies back after executing a queue:

```ruby
hydra = Typhoeus::Hydra.new
requests = 10.times.map {
  request = Typhoeus::Request.new("www.example.com", followlocation: true)
  hydra.queue(request)
  request
}
hydra.run

responses = requests.map { |request|
  request.response.body
}
```
`hydra.run` is a blocking request. You can also use the `on_complete` callback to handle each request as it completes:

```ruby
hydra = Typhoeus::Hydra.new
10.times do
  request = Typhoeus::Request.new("www.example.com", followlocation: true)
  request.on_complete do |response|
    #do_something_with response
  end
  hydra.queue(request)
end
hydra.run
```

### Making Parallel Requests with Faraday + Typhoeus

```ruby
require 'faraday'

conn = Faraday.new(:url => 'http://httppage.com') do |builder|
  builder.request  :url_encoded
  builder.response :logger
  builder.adapter  :typhoeus
end

conn.in_parallel do
  response1 = conn.get('/first')
  response2 = conn.get('/second')

  # these will return nil here since the
  # requests have not been completed
  response1.body
  response2.body
end

# after it has been completed the response information is fully available
# response1.status, etc
response1.body
response2.body
```

### Specifying Max Concurrency

Hydra will also handle how many requests you can make in parallel. Things will get flakey if you try to make too many requests at the same time. The built in limit is 200. When more requests than that are queued up, hydra will save them for later and start the requests as others are finished. You can raise or lower the concurrency limit through the Hydra constructor.

```ruby
Typhoeus::Hydra.new(max_concurrency: 20)
```

### Memoization

Hydra memoizes requests within a single run call. You have to enable memoization.
This will result in a single request being issued. However, the on_complete handlers of both will be called.

```ruby
Typhoeus::Config.memoize = true

hydra = Typhoeus::Hydra.new(max_concurrency: 1)
2.times do
  hydra.queue Typhoeus::Request.new("www.example.com")
end
hydra.run
```

This will result in two requests.

```ruby
Typhoeus::Config.memoize = false

hydra = Typhoeus::Hydra.new(max_concurrency: 1)
2.times do
  hydra.queue Typhoeus::Request.new("www.example.com")
end
hydra.run
```

### Caching

Typhoeus includes built in support for caching. In the following example, if there is a cache hit, the cached object is passed to the on_complete handler of the request object.

```ruby
class Cache
  def initialize
    @memory = {}
  end

  def get(request)
    @memory[request]
  end

  def set(request, response)
    @memory[request] = response
  end
end

Typhoeus::Config.cache = Cache.new

Typhoeus.get("www.example.com").cached?
#=> false
Typhoeus.get("www.example.com").cached?
#=> true
```

For use with [Dalli](https://github.com/mperham/dalli):

```ruby
dalli = Dalli::Client.new(...)
Typhoeus::Config.cache = Typhoeus::Cache::Dalli.new(dalli)
```

For use with Rails:

```ruby
Typhoeus::Config.cache = Typhoeus::Cache::Rails.new
```

For use with [Redis](https://github.com/redis/redis-rb):

```ruby
redis = Redis.new(...)
Typhoeus::Config.cache = Typhoeus::Cache::Redis.new(redis)
```

All three of these adapters take an optional keyword argument `default_ttl`, which sets a default
TTL on cached responses (in seconds), for requests which do not have a cache TTL set.

You may also selectively choose not to cache by setting `cache` to `false` on a request or to use
a different adapter.

```ruby
cache = Cache.new
Typhoeus.get("www.example.com", cache: cache)
```

### Direct Stubbing

Hydra allows you to stub out specific urls and patterns to avoid hitting
remote servers while testing.

```ruby
response = Typhoeus::Response.new(code: 200, body: "{'name' : 'paul'}")
Typhoeus.stub('www.example.com').and_return(response)

Typhoeus.get("www.example.com") == response
#=> true
```

The queued request will hit the stub. You can also specify a regex to match urls.

```ruby
response = Typhoeus::Response.new(code: 200, body: "{'name' : 'paul'}")
Typhoeus.stub(/example/).and_return(response)

Typhoeus.get("www.example.com") == response
#=> true
```

You may also specify an array for the stub to return sequentially.

```ruby
Typhoeus.stub('www.example.com').and_return([response1, response2])

Typhoeus.get('www.example.com') == response1 #=> true
Typhoeus.get('www.example.com') == response2 #=> true
```

When testing make sure to clear your expectations or the stubs will persist between tests. The following can be included in your spec_helper.rb file to do this automatically.

```ruby
RSpec.configure do |config|
  config.before :each do
    Typhoeus::Expectation.clear
  end
end
```

### Timeouts

No exceptions are raised on HTTP timeouts. You can check whether a request timed out with the following method:

```ruby
Typhoeus.get("www.example.com", timeout: 1).timed_out?
```

Timed out responses also have their success? method return false.

There are two different timeouts available: [`timeout`](http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c/curl_easy_setopt.html#CURLOPTTIMEOUT)
and [`connecttimeout`](http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c/curl_easy_setopt.html#CURLOPTCONNECTTIMEOUT).
`timeout` is the time limit for the entire request in seconds.
`connecttimeout` is the time limit for just the connection phase, again in seconds.

There are two additional more fine grained options `timeout_ms` and
`connecttimeout_ms`. These options offer millisecond precision but are not always available (for instance on linux if `nosignal` is not set to true).

When you pass a floating point `timeout` (or `connecttimeout`) Typhoeus will set `timeout_ms` for you if it has not been defined. The actual timeout values passed to curl will always be rounded up.

DNS timeouts of less than one second are not supported unless curl is compiled with an asynchronous resolver.

The default `timeout` is 0 (zero) which means curl never times out during transfer. The default `connecttimeout` is 300 seconds. A `connecttimeout` of 0 will also result in the default `connecttimeout` of 300 seconds.

### Following Redirections

Use `followlocation: true`, eg:

```ruby
Typhoeus.get("www.example.com", followlocation: true)
```

### Basic Authentication

```ruby
Typhoeus::Request.get("www.example.com", userpwd: "user:password")
```

### Compression

```ruby
Typhoeus.get("www.example.com", accept_encoding: "gzip")
```

The above has a different behavior than setting the header directly in the header hash, eg:
```ruby
Typhoeus.get("www.example.com", headers: {"Accept-Encoding" => "gzip"})
```

Setting the header hash directly will not include the `--compressed` flag in the libcurl command and therefore libcurl will not decompress the response.  If you want the `--compressed` flag to be added automatically, set `:accept_encoding` Typhoeus option.


### Cookies

```ruby
Typhoeus::Request.get("www.example.com", cookiefile: "/path/to/file", cookiejar: "/path/to/file")
```

Here, `cookiefile` is a file to read cookies from, and `cookiejar` is a file to write received cookies to.
If you just want cookies enabled, you need to pass the same filename for both options.

### Other CURL options

Are available and documented [here](http://rubydoc.info/github/typhoeus/ethon/Ethon/Easy/Options)

### SSL

SSL comes built in to libcurl so itâ€™s in Typhoeus as well. If you pass in a
url with "https" it should just work assuming that you have your [cert
bundle](http://curl.haxx.se/docs/caextract.html) in order and the server is
verifiable. You must also have libcurl built with SSL support enabled. You can
check that by doing this:

```
curl --version
```

Now, even if you have libcurl built with OpenSSL you may still have a messed
up cert bundle or if youâ€™re hitting a non-verifiable SSL server then youâ€™ll
have to disable peer verification to make SSL work. Like this:

```ruby
Typhoeus.get("https://www.example.com", ssl_verifypeer: false)
```

If you are getting "SSL: certificate subject name does not match target host
name" from curl (ex:- you are trying to access to b.c.host.com when the
certificate subject is \*.host.com). You can disable host verification. Like
this:

```ruby
# host checking enabled
Typhoeus.get("https://www.example.com", ssl_verifyhost: 2)
# host checking disabled
Typhoeus.get("https://www.example.com", ssl_verifyhost: 0)
```

### Verbose debug output

Itâ€™s sometimes useful to see verbose output from curl. You can enable it on a per-request basis:

```ruby
Typhoeus.get("http://example.com", verbose: true)
```

or globally:

```ruby
Typhoeus::Config.verbose = true
```

Just remember that libcurl prints itâ€™s debug output to the console (to
STDERR), so youâ€™ll need to run your scripts from the console to see it.

### Default User Agent Header

In many cases, all HTTP requests made by an application require the same User-Agent header set. Instead of supplying it on a per-request basis by supplying a custom header, it is possible to override it for all requests using:


```ruby
Typhoeus::Config.user_agent = "custom user agent"
```

### Running the specs

Running the specs should be as easy as:

```
bundle install
bundle exec rake
```
