* `Request#url` now also contains the url parameters.

  ([Dwayne Macgowan](https://github.com/dwaynemac), [\#224](https://github.com/typhoeus/typhoeus/issues/224))
* Handled response is available again.
* Rename parameter `url` to `base_url`. See discussion here: [\#250](https://github.com/typhoeus/typhoeus/issues/250).

## 0.5.3

[Full Changelog](http://github.com/typhoeus/typhoeus/compare/v0.5.2...v0.5.3)

Enhancements:

* When checking options in Expecation#matches? also consider Request#options.

Bugfixes:

* Do not break backwards compatibility with case insensitive headers access.
* Make sure hydra behaves correct in case of before hooks.

## 0.5.2

[Full Changelog](http://github.com/typhoeus/typhoeus/compare/v0.5.1...v0.5.2)

Enhancements:

* Do not check the return_code in Response#success? when response is mocked.
* Check for memoization, stubbing, before hooks are delayed to Hydra#run. It
  was on Hydra#queue before and led to strange behavior because if the request
  was stubbed, it was wrapped up in queue already. There was no way to add
  callbacks after queue thatswhy. This is now different, since everything happens
  in run, just as you expect.

## 0.5.1

[Full Changelog](http://github.com/typhoeus/typhoeus/compare/v0.5.0...v0.5.1)

Enhancements:

* Downcase header keys for easier access
  ( [\#227](https://github.com/typhoeus/typhoeus/issues/227) )
* Using an updated Ethon version.

## 0.5.0

[Full Changelog](http://github.com/typhoeus/typhoeus/compare/v0.4.2...v0.5.0)

Major Changes:

* Ethon integration
  * Params are url params and a body is always a body for every request type
  * The options you can set might have a slightly other names, as Ethon sticks to
    libcurl names. See
    [Easy.new](http://rubydoc.info/github/typhoeus/ethon/Ethon/Easy#initialize-instance_method)
    for a description.
  * Request parameter and body are properly encoded (only POST multiform body is not)
  * No more header sanitizing. Before: `:headers => { 'user_agent' => 'Custom' }` was modified to
        `:headers => { 'User-Agent' => 'Custom' }`
  * `Typhoeus::Easy` and `Typhoeus::Multi` are now `Ethon::Easy` and `Ethon::Multi`

* Request shortcuts: `Typhoeus.get("www.google.de")`
* Global configuration:
```ruby
Typhoeus.configure do |config|
  config.verbose = true
  config.memoize = true
end
```
* No more `Response#headers_hash`, instead `Response#headers` returning the last
  header and response#redirections returning the responses with headers
  generated through redirections
* Instead of defining the same callbacks on every request, you can define global callbacks:
```ruby
Typhoeus.on_complete { p "yay" }
```
* The stubbing interface changed slightly. You now have the same syntax as for requests:
```ruby
Typhoeus.stub(url, options).and_return(response)
```
* The following things were removed because they do not seemed to be used at all. Ping me if you disagree!
  * `Typhoeus::Filter`
  * `Typhoeus::Remote`
  * `Typhoeus::RemoteMethod`
  * `Typhoeus::RemoteProxyObject`
  * build in cache interface

Enhancements:

* Documentation
  ( [Alex P](https://github.com/ifesdjeen), [\#188](https://github.com/typhoeus/typhoeus/issues/188) )
* Request#on\_complete can hold multiple blocks.
* Request#eql? recognizes when header/params/body has a different order, but still same keys and values
  ( [Alex P](https://github.com/ifesdjeen), [\#194](https://github.com/typhoeus/typhoeus/issues/194) )

Bug Fixes:

* Zero bytes in strings are escaped for libcurl
* Add support for socks5 hostname proxy type
  ( [eweathers](https://github.com/eweathers), [\#183](https://github.com/typhoeus/typhoeus/issues/183) )
* Post body is encoded
  ( [Rohan Deshpande](https://github.com/rdeshpande), [\#143](https://github.com/typhoeus/typhoeus/issues/143) )
* Set default user agent
  ( [Steven Shingler](https://github.com/sshingler), [\#176](https://github.com/typhoeus/typhoeus/issues/176) )
