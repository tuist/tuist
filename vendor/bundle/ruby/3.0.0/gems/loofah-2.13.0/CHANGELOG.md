## 2.2.3 / 2018-10-30

### Security

Address CVE-2018-16468: Unsanitized JavaScript may occur in sanitized output when a crafted SVG element is republished.

This CVE's public notice is at [#154](https://github.com/flavorjones/loofah/issues/154)


## Meta / 2018-10-27

The mailing list is now on Google Groups [#146](https://github.com/flavorjones/loofah/issues/146):

* Mail: loofah-talk@googlegroups.com
* Archive: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/loofah-talk

## 2.2.2 / 2018-03-22

Make public `Loofah::HTML5::Scrub.force_correct_attribute_escaping!`,

attribute scrubbers should they need to address CVE-2018-8048.

* Declaring encoding in html5/scrub.rb. Without this, use of the ruby -KU option would cause havoc. ([#32](https://github.com/flavorjones/loofah/issues/32))


## 1.2.0 (2011-08-08)

### Enhancements:

* Loofah::Helpers.sanitize_css is a replacement for Rails's built-in sanitize_css helper.
* Improving ActionView integration.


## 1.1.0 (2011-08-08)

### Enhancements:

* Additional HTML5lib whitelist elements (from html5lib 1524:80b5efe26230).
  Up to date with HTML5lib ruby code as of 1723:7ee6a0331856.

### Notes:

* Moved ActiveRecord functionality into `loofah-activerecord` gem.
* Removed DEPRECATIONS.rdoc documenting 0.3.0 API changes.


## 0.4.7 (2010-03-09)

### Enhancements:

* New methods Loofah::HTML::Document#to_text and
  Loofah::HTML::DocumentFragment#to_text do the right thing with
  whitespace. Note that these methods are significantly slower than
  #text. GH [#12](https://github.com/flavorjones/loofah/issues/12)
* Loofah::Elements::BLOCK_LEVEL contains a canonical list of HTML4 block-level4 elements.
* Loofah::HTML::Document#text and Loofah::HTML::DocumentFragment#text

### Enhancements:

* Loofah::HTML::Document#text and Loofah::HTML::DocumentFragment#text now escape HTML entities.

## 0.4.3 (2010-01-29)

### Enhancements:

* All built-in scrubbers are accepted by ActiveRecord::Base.xss_foliate
* Loofah::XssFoliate.xss_foliate_all_models replaces use of the constant LOOFAH_XSS_FOLIATE_ALL_MODELS

### Miscellaneous:

* Modified documentation for bootstrapping XssFoliate in a Rails app,
  since the use of Bundler breaks the previously-documented method. To
  be safe, always use an initializer file.


## 0.4.2 (2010-01-22)

### Enhancements:

* Implemented Node#scrub! for scrubbing subtrees.
* Implemented NodeSet#scrub! for scrubbing a set of subtrees.
* Document.text now only serializes <body> contents (ignores <head>)

  details on the equivalent calls with the post-0.2 API.


## 0.2.2 (2009-09-30)

### Enhancements:

* ActiveRecord extension scrubs fields in a before_validation callback
  (was previously in a before_save)

  with html_fragment and html_document. GH [#6](https://github.com/flavorjones/loofah/issues/6) (Thanks Josh Nichols!)

  DocumentFragment objects. GH [#5](https://github.com/flavorjones/loofah/issues/5)
