## Rails 6.1.4.4 (December 15, 2021) ##

*   Fix issue with host protection not allowing host with port in development.


## Rails 6.1.4.3 (December 14, 2021) ##

*    Fix issue with host protection not allowing localhost in development.


## Rails 6.1.4.2 (December 14, 2021) ##

*   Fix X_FORWARDED_HOST protection.  [CVE-2021-44528]

## Rails 6.1.4.1 (August 19, 2021) ##

*   [CVE-2021-22942] Fix possible open redirect in Host Authorization middleware.

    Specially crafted "X-Forwarded-Host" headers in combination with certain
    "allowed host" formats can cause the Host Authorization middleware in Action
    Pack to redirect users to a malicious website.

## Rails 6.1.4 (June 24, 2021) ##

*   Ignore file fixtures on `db:fixtures:load`

    *Kevin Sjöberg*

*   Fix ActionController::Live controller test deadlocks by removing the body buffer size limit for tests.

    *Dylan Thacker-Smith*

*   Correctly place optional path parameter booleans.

    Previously, if you specify a url parameter that is part of the path as false it would include that part
    of the path as parameter for example:

    ```
    get "(/optional/:optional_id)/things" => "foo#foo", as: :things
    things_path(optional_id: false) # => /things?optional_id=false
    ```

    After this change, true and false will be treated the same when used as optional path parameters. Meaning now:

    ```
    get '(this/:my_bool)/that' as: :that

    that_path(my_bool: true) # => `/this/true/that`
    that_path(my_bool: false) # => `/this/false/that`
    ```

    *Adam Hess*

*   Add support for 'private, no-store' Cache-Control headers.

    Previously, 'no-store' was exclusive; no other directives could be specified.

    *Alex Smith*


## Rails 6.1.3.2 (May 05, 2021) ##

*   Prevent open redirects by correctly escaping the host allow list
    CVE-2021-22903

*   Prevent catastrophic backtracking during mime parsing
    CVE-2021-22902

*   Prevent regex DoS in HTTP token authentication
    CVE-2021-22904

*   Prevent string polymorphic route arguments.

    `url_for` supports building polymorphic URLs via an array
    of arguments (usually symbols and records). If a developer passes a
    user input array, strings can result in unwanted route helper calls.

    CVE-2021-22885

    *Gannon McGibbon*

## Rails 6.1.3.1 (March 26, 2021) ##

*   No changes.


## Rails 6.1.3 (February 17, 2021) ##

*   Re-define routes when not set correctly via inheritance.

    *John Hawthorn*


## Rails 6.1.2.1 (February 10, 2021) ##

*   Prevent open redirect when allowed host starts with a dot

    [CVE-2021-22881]

    Thanks to @tktech (https://hackerone.com/tktech) for reporting this
    issue and the patch!

    *Aaron Patterson*


## Rails 6.1.2 (February 09, 2021) ##

*   Fix error in `ActionController::LogSubscriber` that would happen when throwing inside a controller action.

    *Janko Marohnić*

*   Fix `fixture_file_upload` deprecation when `file_fixture_path` is a relative path.

    *Eugene Kenny*


## Rails 6.1.1 (January 07, 2021) ##

*   Fix nil translation key lookup in controllers/

    *Jan Klimo*

*   Quietly handle unknown HTTP methods in Action Dispatch SSL middleware.

    *Alex Robbin*

*   Change the request method to a `GET` when passing failed requests down to `config.exceptions_app`.

    *Alex Robbin*


## Rails 6.1.0 (December 09, 2020) ##

*   Support for the HTTP header `Feature-Policy` has been revised to reflect
    its [rename](https://github.com/w3c/webappsec-permissions-policy/pull/379) to [`Permissions-Policy`](https://w3c.github.io/webappsec-permissions-policy/#permissions-policy-http-header-field).

    ```ruby
    Rails.application.config.permissions_policy do |p|
      p.camera     :none
      p.gyroscope  :none
      p.microphone :none
      p.usb        :none
      p.fullscreen :self
      p.payment    :self, "https://secure-example.com"
    end
    ```

    *Julien Grillot*

*   Allow `ActionDispatch::HostAuthorization` to exclude specific requests.

    Host Authorization checks can be skipped for specific requests. This allows for health check requests to be permitted for requests with missing or non-matching host headers.

    *Chris Bisnett*

*   Add `config.action_dispatch.request_id_header` to allow changing the name of
    the unique X-Request-Id header

    *Arlston Fernandes*

*   Deprecate `config.action_dispatch.return_only_media_type_on_content_type`.

    *Rafael Mendonça França*

*   Change `ActionDispatch::Response#content_type` to return the full Content-Type header.

    *Rafael Mendonça França*

*   Remove deprecated `ActionDispatch::Http::ParameterFilter`.

    *Rafael Mendonça França*

*   Added support for exclusive no-store Cache-Control header.

    If `no-store` is set on Cache-Control header it is exclusive (all other cache directives are dropped).

    *Chris Kruger*

*   Catch invalid UTF-8 parameters for POST requests and respond with BadRequest.

    Additionally, perform `#set_binary_encoding` in `ActionDispatch::Http::Request#GET` and
    `ActionDispatch::Http::Request#POST` prior to validating encoding.

    *Adrianna Chang*

*   Allow `assert_recognizes` routing assertions to work on mounted root routes.

    *Gannon McGibbon*

*   Change default redirection status code for non-GET/HEAD requests to 308 Permanent Redirect for `ActionDispatch::SSL`.

    *Alan Tan*, *Oz Ben-David*

*   Fix `follow_redirect!` to follow redirection with same HTTP verb when following
    a 308 redirection.

    *Alan Tan*

*   When multiple domains are specified for a cookie, a domain will now be
    chosen only if it is equal to or is a superdomain of the request host.

    *Jonathan Hefner*

*   `ActionDispatch::Static` handles precompiled Brotli (.br) files.

    Adds to existing support for precompiled gzip (.gz) files.
    Brotli files are preferred due to much better compression.

    When the browser requests /some.js with `Accept-Encoding: br`,
    we check for public/some.js.br and serve that file, if present, with
    `Content-Encoding: br` and `Vary: Accept-Encoding` headers.

    *Ryan Edward Hall*, *Jeremy Daer*

*   Add raise_on_missing_translations support for controllers.

    This configuration determines whether an error should be raised for missing translations.
    It can be enabled through `config.i18n.raise_on_missing_translations`. Note that described
    configuration also affects raising error for missing translations in views.

    *fatkodima*

*   Added `compact` and `compact!` to `ActionController::Parameters`.

    *Eugene Kenny*

*   Calling `each_pair` or `each_value` on an `ActionController::Parameters`
    without passing a block now returns an enumerator.

    *Eugene Kenny*

*   `fixture_file_upload` now uses path relative to `file_fixture_path`

    Previously the path had to be relative to `fixture_path`.
    You can change your existing code as follow:

    ```ruby
    # Before
    fixture_file_upload('files/dog.png')

    # After
    fixture_file_upload('dog.png')
    ```

    *Edouard Chin*

*   Remove deprecated `force_ssl` at the controller level.

    *Rafael Mendonça França*

*   The +helper+ class method for controllers loads helper modules specified as
    strings/symbols with `String#constantize` instead of `require_dependency`.

    Remember that support for strings/symbols is only a convenient API. You can
    always pass a module object:

    ```ruby
    helper UtilsHelper
    ```

    which is recommended because it is simple and direct. When a string/symbol
    is received, `helper` just manipulates and inflects the argument to obtain
    that same module object.

    *Xavier Noria*, *Jean Boussier*

*   Correctly identify the entire localhost IPv4 range as trusted proxy.

    *Nick Soracco*

*   `url_for` will now use "https://" as the default protocol when
    `Rails.application.config.force_ssl` is set to true.

    *Jonathan Hefner*

*   Accept and default to base64_urlsafe CSRF tokens.

    Base64 strict-encoded CSRF tokens are not inherently websafe, which makes
    them difficult to deal with. For example, the common practice of sending
    the CSRF token to a browser in a client-readable cookie does not work properly
    out of the box: the value has to be url-encoded and decoded to survive transport.

    Now, we generate Base64 urlsafe-encoded CSRF tokens, which are inherently safe
    to transport. Validation accepts both urlsafe tokens, and strict-encoded tokens
    for backwards compatibility.

    *Scott Blum*

*   Support rolling deploys for cookie serialization/encryption changes.

    In a distributed configuration like rolling update, users may observe
    both old and new instances during deployment. Users may be served by a
    new instance and then by an old instance.

    That means when the server changes `cookies_serializer` from `:marshal`
    to `:hybrid` or the server changes `use_authenticated_cookie_encryption`
    from `false` to `true`, users may lose their sessions if they access the
    server during deployment.

    We added fallbacks to downgrade the cookie format when necessary during
    deployment, ensuring compatibility on both old and new instances.

    *Masaki Hara*

*   `ActionDispatch::Request.remote_ip` has ip address even when all sites are trusted.

    Before, if all `X-Forwarded-For` sites were trusted, the `remote_ip` would default to `127.0.0.1`.
    Now, the furthest proxy site is used. e.g.: It now gives an ip address when using curl from the load balancer.

    *Keenan Brock*

*   Fix possible information leak / session hijacking vulnerability.

    The `ActionDispatch::Session::MemcacheStore` is still vulnerable given it requires the
    gem dalli to be updated as well.

    CVE-2019-16782.

*   Include child session assertion count in ActionDispatch::IntegrationTest.

    `IntegrationTest#open_session` uses `dup` to create the new session, which
    meant it had its own copy of `@assertions`. This prevented the assertions
    from being correctly counted and reported.

    Child sessions now have their `attr_accessor` overridden to delegate to the
    root session.

    Fixes #32142.

    *Sam Bostock*

*   Add SameSite protection to every written cookie.

    Enabling `SameSite` cookie protection is an addition to CSRF protection,
    where cookies won't be sent by browsers in cross-site POST requests when set to `:lax`.

    `:strict` disables cookies being sent in cross-site GET or POST requests.

    Passing `:none` disables this protection and is the same as previous versions albeit a `; SameSite=None` is appended to the cookie.

    See upgrade instructions in config/initializers/new_framework_defaults_6_1.rb.

    More info [here](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-west-first-party-cookies-07)

    _NB: Technically already possible as Rack supports SameSite protection, this is to ensure it's applied to all cookies_

    *Cédric Fabianski*

*   Bring back the feature that allows loading external route files from the router.

    This feature existed back in 2012 but got reverted with the incentive that
    https://github.com/rails/routing_concerns was a better approach. Turned out
    that this wasn't fully the case and loading external route files from the router
    can be helpful for applications with a really large set of routes.
    Without this feature, application needs to implement routes reloading
    themselves and it's not straightforward.

    ```ruby
    # config/routes.rb

    Rails.application.routes.draw do
      draw(:admin)
    end

    # config/routes/admin.rb

    get :foo, to: 'foo#bar'
    ```

    *Yehuda Katz*, *Edouard Chin*

*   Fix system test driver option initialization for non-headless browsers.

    *glaszig*

*   `redirect_to.action_controller` notifications now include the `ActionDispatch::Request` in
    their payloads as `:request`.

    *Austin Story*

*   `respond_to#any` no longer returns a response's Content-Type based on the
    request format but based on the block given.

    Example:

    ```ruby
      def my_action
        respond_to do |format|
          format.any { render(json: { foo: 'bar' }) }
        end
      end

      get('my_action.csv')
    ```

    The previous behaviour was to respond with a `text/csv` Content-Type which
    is inaccurate since a JSON response is being rendered.

    Now it correctly returns a `application/json` Content-Type.

    *Edouard Chin*

*   Replaces (back)slashes in failure screenshot image paths with dashes.

    If a failed test case contained a slash or a backslash, a screenshot would be created in a
    nested directory, causing issues with `tmp:clear`.

    *Damir Zekic*

*   Add `params.member?` to mimic Hash behavior.

    *Younes Serraj*

*   `process_action.action_controller` notifications now include the following in their payloads:

    * `:request` - the `ActionDispatch::Request`
    * `:response` - the `ActionDispatch::Response`

    *George Claghorn*

*   Updated `ActionDispatch::Request.remote_ip` setter to clear set the instance
    `remote_ip` to `nil` before setting the header that the value is derived
    from.

    Fixes #37383.

    *Norm Provost*

*   `ActionController::Base.log_at` allows setting a different log level per request.

    ```ruby
    # Use the debug level if a particular cookie is set.
    class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
      log_at :debug, if: -> { cookies[:debug] }
    end
    ```

    *George Claghorn*

*   Allow system test screen shots to be taken more than once in
    a test by prefixing the file name with an incrementing counter.

    Add an environment variable `RAILS_SYSTEM_TESTING_SCREENSHOT_HTML` to
    enable saving of HTML during a screenshot in addition to the image.
    This uses the same image name, with the extension replaced with `.html`

    *Tom Fakes*

*   Add `Vary: Accept` header when using `Accept` header for response.

    For some requests like `/users/1`, Rails uses requests' `Accept`
    header to determine what to return. And if we don't add `Vary`
    in the response header, browsers might accidentally cache different
    types of content, which would cause issues: e.g. javascript got displayed
    instead of html content. This PR fixes these issues by adding `Vary: Accept`
    in these types of requests. For more detailed problem description, please read:

    https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/36213

    Fixes #25842.

    *Stan Lo*

*   Fix IntegrationTest `follow_redirect!` to follow redirection using the same HTTP verb when following
    a 307 redirection.

    *Edouard Chin*

*   System tests require Capybara 3.26 or newer.

    *George Claghorn*

*   Reduced log noise handling ActionController::RoutingErrors.

    *Alberto Fernández-Capel*

*   Add DSL for configuring HTTP Feature Policy.

    This new DSL provides a way to configure an HTTP Feature Policy at a
    global or per-controller level. Full details of HTTP Feature Policy
    specification and guidelines can be found at MDN:

    https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Feature-Policy

    Example global policy:

    ```ruby
    Rails.application.config.feature_policy do |f|
      f.camera      :none
      f.gyroscope   :none
      f.microphone  :none
      f.usb         :none
      f.fullscreen  :self
      f.payment     :self, "https://secure.example.com"
    end
    ```

    Example controller level policy:

    ```ruby
    class PagesController < ApplicationController
      feature_policy do |p|
        p.geolocation "https://example.com"
      end
    end
    ```

    *Jacob Bednarz*

*   Add the ability to set the CSP nonce only to the specified directives.

    Fixes #35137.

    *Yuji Yaginuma*

*   Keep part when scope option has value.

    When a route was defined within an optional scope, if that route didn't
    take parameters the scope was lost when using path helpers. This commit
    ensures scope is kept both when the route takes parameters or when it
    doesn't.

    Fixes #33219.

    *Alberto Almagro*

*   Added `deep_transform_keys` and `deep_transform_keys!` methods to ActionController::Parameters.

    *Gustavo Gutierrez*

*   Calling `ActionController::Parameters#transform_keys`/`!` without a block now returns
    an enumerator for the parameters instead of the underlying hash.

    *Eugene Kenny*

*   Fix strong parameters blocks all attributes even when only some keys are invalid (non-numerical).
    It should only block invalid key's values instead.

    *Stan Lo*
