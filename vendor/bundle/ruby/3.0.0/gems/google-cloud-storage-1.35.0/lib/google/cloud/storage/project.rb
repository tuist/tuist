        # @param [String, nil] bucket Name of the bucket, or nil if URL for all
        #   buckets is desired.
        # @param [String] path Path to the file in Google Cloud Storage.
        # @param [String] method The HTTP verb to be used with the signed URL.
        #   Signed URLs can be used
        #   with `GET`, `HEAD`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` requests. Default is `GET`.
        # @param [Integer] expires The number of seconds until the URL expires.
        #   If the `version` is `:v2`, the default is 300 (5 minutes). If the
        #   `version` is `:v4`, the default is 604800 (7 days).

        #   send this value in the HTTP header. e.g. `text/plain`. This param is
        #   not used if the `version` is `:v4`.
        # @param [String] content_md5 The MD5 digest value in base64. If you
        #   provide this in the string, the client (usually a browser) must
        #   provide this HTTP header with this same value in its request. This
        #   param is not used if the `version` is `:v4`.
        # @param [Hash] headers Google extension headers (custom HTTP headers
        #   that begin with `x-goog-`) that must be included in requests that
        #   use the signed URL.
        # @param [String] issuer Service Account's Client Email.
        # @param [String] client_email Service Account's Client Email.
        # @param [OpenSSL::PKey::RSA, String, Proc] signing_key Service Account's
        #   Private Key or a Proc that accepts a single String parameter and returns a
        #   RSA SHA256 signature using a valid Google Service Account Private Key.
        # @param [OpenSSL::PKey::RSA, String, Proc] private_key Service Account's
        #   Private Key or a Proc that accepts a single String parameter and returns a
        #   RSA SHA256 signature using a valid Google Service Account Private Key.
        # @param [OpenSSL::PKey::RSA, String, Proc] signer Service Account's
        #   Private Key or a Proc that accepts a single String parameter and returns a
        #   RSA SHA256 signature using a valid Google Service Account Private Key.
        #
        #   When using this method in environments such as GAE Flexible Environment,
        #   GKE, or Cloud Functions where the private key is unavailable, it may be
        #   necessary to provide a Proc (or lambda) via the signer parameter. This
        #   Proc should return a signature created using a RPC call to the
        #   [Service Account Credentials signBlob](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/reference/credentials/rest/v1/projects.serviceAccounts/signBlob)
        #   method as shown in the example below.
        # @param [Hash] query Query string parameters to include in the signed
        #   URL. The given parameters are not verified by the signature.
        #
        #   Parameters such as `response-content-disposition` and
        #   `response-content-type` can alter the behavior of the response when
        #   using the URL, but only when the file resource is missing the
        #   corresponding values. (These values can be permanently set using
        #   {File#content_disposition=} and {File#content_type=}.)
        # @param [String] scheme The URL scheme. The default value is `HTTPS`.
        # @param [Boolean] virtual_hosted_style Whether to use a virtual hosted-style
        #   hostname, which adds the bucket into the host portion of the URI rather
        #   than the path, e.g. `https://mybucket.storage.googleapis.com/...`.
        #   For V4 signing, this also sets the `host` header in the canonicalized
        #   extension headers to the virtual hosted-style host, unless that header is
        #   supplied via the `headers` param. The default value of `false` uses the
        #   form of `https://storage.googleapis.com/mybucket`.
        # @param [String] bucket_bound_hostname Use a bucket-bound hostname, which
        #   replaces the `storage.googleapis.com` host with the name of a `CNAME`
        #   bucket, e.g. a bucket named `gcs-subdomain.my.domain.tld`, or a Google
        #   Cloud Load Balancer which routes to a bucket you own, e.g.
        #   `my-load-balancer-domain.tld`.
        # @param [Symbol, String] version The version of the signed credential
        #   to create. Must be one of `:v2` or `:v4`. The default value is
        #   `:v2`.
