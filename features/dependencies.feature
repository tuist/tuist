# TODO: Fix
# Feature: Tuist dependencies.

#     Scenario: The project is an application with SPM Dependencies.swift (app_with_spm_dependencies)
#         Given that tuist is available
#         And I have a working directory
#         Then I copy the fixture app_with_spm_dependencies into the working directory
#         Then tuist fetches dependencies
#         Then tuist generates the project
#         Then tuist builds the scheme App from the project

#     Scenario: The project is a sub project within a workspace with SPM Dependencies.swift (app_with_spm_dependencies)
#         Given that tuist is available
#         And I have a working directory
#         Then I copy the fixture app_with_spm_dependencies into the working directory
#         Then tuist fetches dependencies
#         Then tuist generates the project at /Features/FeatureOne
#         Then tuist builds the scheme FeatureOneFramework_iOS from the project at Features/FeatureOne
