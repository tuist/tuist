```swift
public struct Project: Codable, Equatable
```

A project representation.

A project manifest needs to be defined in a `Project.swift` manifest file.
Manifests need to import the framework ProjectDescription which contains all
the classes and enums that are available for you to describe your projects.

The snippet below shows an example project manifest:

```swift
import ProjectDescription

let project = Project(
    name: "MyProject",
    organizationName: "MyOrg",
    targets: [
        Target(
            name: "App",
            destinations: .iOS,
            product: .app,
            bundleId: "io.tuist.App",
            infoPlist: "Config/App-Info.plist",
            sources: ["Sources/**"],
            resources: [
                "Resources/**",
                .folderReference(path: "Stubs"),
                .folderReference(path: "ODR", tags: ["odr_tag"])
            ],
            headers: .headers(
                public: ["Sources/public/A/**", "Sources/public/B/**"],
                private: "Sources/private/**",
                project: ["Sources/project/A/**", "Sources/project/B/**"]
            ),
            dependencies: [
                .project(target: "Framework1", path: "../Framework1"),
                .project(target: "Framework2", path: "../Framework2")
            ]
        )
    ],
    schemes: [
        Scheme(
            name: "App-Debug",
            shared: true,
            buildAction: .buildAction(targets: ["App"]),
            testAction: .targets(["AppTests"]),
            runAction: .runAction(executable: "App")
        ),
        Scheme(
            name: "App-Release",
            shared: true,
            buildAction: .buildAction(targets: ["App"]),
            runAction: .runAction(executable: "App")
        )
    ],
    additionalFiles: [
        "Dangerfile.swift",
        "Documentation/**",
        .folderReference(path: "Website")
    ]
)
```

## Properties
### `name`

```swift
public let name: String
```

The name of the project. Also, the file name of the generated Xcode project.

### `organizationName`

### `options`

```swift
public let options: Options
```

The project options.

### `packages`

```swift
public let packages: [Package]
```

The Swift Packages used by the project.

### `targets`

```swift
public let targets: [Target]
```

The targets of the project.

### `schemes`

```swift
public let schemes: [Scheme]
```

The custom schemes for the project. Default schemes for each target are generated by default.

### `settings`

```swift
public let settings: Settings?
```

### `fileHeaderTemplate`

```swift
public let fileHeaderTemplate: FileHeaderTemplate?
```

The custom file header template for Xcode built-in file templates.

### `additionalFiles`

```swift
public let additionalFiles: [FileElement]
```

The additional files for the project. For target's additional files, see ``Target/additionalFiles``.

### `resourceSynthesizers`

```swift
public let resourceSynthesizers: [ResourceSynthesizer]
```

The resource synthesizers for the project to generate accessors for resources.

### `containsExternalDependencies`

```swift
public var containsExternalDependencies: Bool
```

## Methods
### `init(name:organizationName:options:packages:settings:targets:schemes:fileHeaderTemplate:additionalFiles:resourceSynthesizers:)`

```swift
public init(
    name: String,
    organizationName: String? = nil,
    options: Options = .options(),
    packages: [Package] = [],
    settings: Settings? = nil,
    targets: [Target] = [],
    schemes: [Scheme] = [],
    fileHeaderTemplate: FileHeaderTemplate? = nil,
    additionalFiles: [FileElement] = [],
    resourceSynthesizers: [ResourceSynthesizer] = .default
)
```
