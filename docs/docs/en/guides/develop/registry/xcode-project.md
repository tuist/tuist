# Xcode project {#xcode-project}

To add packages using the registry in your Xcode project, use the default Xcode UI. You can search for packages in the registry by clicking on the `+` button in the `Package Dependencies` tab in Xcode. If the package is available in the registry, you will see the `tuist.dev` registry in the top right:

> [!NOTE]
> Xcode currently doesn't support automatically replacing source control packages with their registry equivalents. You will need to manually remove the source control package and add the registry package to speed up the resolution.
