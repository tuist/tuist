# Generated project with the XcodeProj-based package integration {#generated-project-with-xcodeproj-based-integration}

When using the <LocalizedLink href="/guides/develop/projects/dependencies#tuists-xcodeprojbased-integration">XcodeProj-based integration</LocalizedLink>, you can use the ``--replace-scm-with-registry`` flag to resolve dependencies from the registry if they are available. Add it to the `installOptions` in your `Tuist.swift` file:
```swift
import ProjectDescription

let tuist = Tuist(
    fullHandle: "{account-handle}/{project-handle}",
    project: .tuist(
        installOptions: .options(passthroughSwiftPackageManagerArguments: ["--replace-scm-with-registry"])
    )
)
```

If you want to ensure that the registry is used every time you resolve dependencies, you will need to update `dependencies` in your `Tuist/Package.swift` file to use the registry identifier instead of a URL. The registry identifier is always in the form of `{organization}.{repository}`. For example, to use the registry for the `swift-composable-architecture` package, do the following:
```diff
dependencies: [
-   .package(url: "https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture", from: "0.1.0")
+   .package(id: "pointfreeco.swift-composable-architecture", from: "0.1.0")
]
```
