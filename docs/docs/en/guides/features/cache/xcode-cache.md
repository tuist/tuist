# Xcode Cache {#xcode-cache}

::: warning EXPERIMENTAL FEATURE
This feature is currently experimental.
:::

Tuist provides support for the new Xcode caching capability, which allows teams to share compilation artifacts by leveraging the build system's caching capabilities.

## Setup {#setup}

::: warning REQUIREMENTS
<!-- -->
- A <LocalizedLink href="/guides/server/accounts-and-projects">Tuist account and project</LocalizedLink>
- Xcode 26.0 or later
<!-- -->
:::

If you don't already have a Tuist account and project, you can create one by running:

```bash
tuist init
```

Once you have a `Tuist.swift` file referencing your `fullHandle`, you can set up the caching for your project by running:

```bash
tuist setup cache
```

This command creates a LaunchAgent to run a local cache service on startup that the Swift build system uses to share compilation artifacts. This command needs to be run once in both your local and CI environments.

To set up the cache on the CI, make sure you are <LocalizedLink href="/guides/integrations/continuous-integration#authentication">authenticated</LocalizedLink>.

### Configure Xcode Build Settings {#configure-xcode-build-settings}

Add the following build settings to your Xcode project:

```
COMPILATION_CACHE_ENABLE_CACHING = YES
COMPILATION_CACHE_REMOTE_SERVICE_PATH = $HOME/.local/state/tuist/your_org_your_project.sock
COMPILATION_CACHE_ENABLE_PLUGIN = YES
```

Note that `COMPILATION_CACHE_REMOTE_SERVICE_PATH` and `COMPILATION_CACHE_ENABLE_PLUGIN` need to be added as **user-defined build settings** since they're not directly exposed in Xcode's build settings UI:

::: info SOCKET PATH
The socket path will be displayed when you run `tuist setup cache`. It's based on your project's full handle with slashes replaced by underscores.
:::

You can also specify these settings when running `xcodebuild` by adding the following flags, such as:

```
xcodebuild build -project YourProject.xcodeproj -scheme YourScheme \
    COMPILATION_CACHE_ENABLE_CACHING=YES \
    COMPILATION_CACHE_REMOTE_SERVICE_PATH=$HOME/.local/state/tuist/your_org_your_project.sock \
    COMPILATION_CACHE_ENABLE_PLUGIN=YES
```

::: info GENERATED PROJECTS
Setting the settings manually is not needed if your project is generated by Tuist.

In that case, all you need is to add `enableCaching: true` to your `Tuist.swift` file:
```swift
import ProjectDescription

let tuist = Tuist(
    fullHandle: "your-org/your-project",
    url: "https://cloud.tuist.io",
    project: .tuist(
        generationOptions: .options(
            enableCaching: true
        )
    )
)
```
