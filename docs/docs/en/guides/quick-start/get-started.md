# Get started {#get-started}

The easiest way to get started with Tuist in any directory or in the directory of your Xcode project or workspace:

```bash
tuist init
```

The command will walk you through the steps to <LocalizedLink href="/guides/develop/projects">create a generated project</LocalizedLink> or integrate an existing Xcode project or workspace. It helps you connect your setup to the remote server, giving you access to features like <LocalizedLink href="/guides/develop/selective-testing">selective testing</LocalizedLink>, <LocalizedLink href="/guides/share/previews">previews</LocalizedLink>, and the <LocalizedLink href="/guides/develop/registry">registry</LocalizedLink>.

> [!NOTE] MIGRATE AN EXISTING PROJECT
> If you want to migrate an existing project to generated projects to improve the developer experience and take advantage of our <LocalizedLink href="/guides/develop/cache">cache</LocalizedLink>, check out our <LocalizedLink href="/guides/develop/projects/adoption/migrate/xcode-project">migration guide</LocalizedLink>.
