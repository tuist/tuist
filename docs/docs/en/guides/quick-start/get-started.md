# Get started {#get-started}

The easiest way to get started with Tuist in any directory or in the directory of your Xcode project or workspace:

::: code-group

```bash [Mise]
mise x tuist@latest -- tuist init
```

```bash [Global Tuist (Homebrew)]
tuist init
```
:::

The command will walk you through the steps to <LocalizedLink href="/guides/features/projects">create a generated project</LocalizedLink> or integrate an existing Xcode project or workspace. It helps you connect your setup to the remote server, giving you access to features like <LocalizedLink href="/guides/features/selective-testing">selective testing</LocalizedLink>, <LocalizedLink href="/guides/features/previews">previews</LocalizedLink>, and the <LocalizedLink href="/guides/features/registry">registry</LocalizedLink>.

> [!NOTE] MIGRATE AN EXISTING PROJECT
