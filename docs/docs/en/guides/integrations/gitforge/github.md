# GitHub integration {#github}

Git repositories are the centerpiece of the vast majority of software projects out there. We integrate with GitHub to provide Tuist insights right in your pull requests and to save you some configuration such as syncing your default branch.

## Setup {#setup}

You will need to install the Tuist GitHub app in the `Integrations` tab of your organization:

After that, you can add a project connection between your GitHub repository and your Tuist project:
