# Run

Unlike Xcode's GUI, Xcode's CLI, `xcodebuild`, doesn't provide a way to run the compiled artifacts of your project. Tuist provides a command to run the compiled artifacts of your project, such as iOS apps.

> [!TIP] ONLY IOS APPS SUPPORTED
> We currently only support running iOS apps. Support for other platforms is planned.

## Run an iOS app

The `tuist run` command generates the project if needed, then compiles it with `xcodebuild`, and launches the built artifact from the derived data directory in the specified simulator.

::: code-group

```bash [Run on iPhone 15 with iOS 17.4.1]
tuist run MyApp --device "iPhone 15" --os "17.4.1"
```
:::

> [!NOTE] EXISTING SIMULATORS
> If Tuist can't find a destination that matches the specified device and OS or none is provided, it will ask in which available simulator to run, in case of many available, or pick the only one available otherwise.
