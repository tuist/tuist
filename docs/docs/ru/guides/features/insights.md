Working on large projects shouldn't feel like a chore. In fact, it should be as
enjoyable as working on a project you started just two weeks ago. One of the
reasons it is not is because as the project grows, the developer experience
suffers. The build times increase and tests become slow and flaky. It's often
easy to overlook these issues until it gets to a point where they become
unbearable – however, at that point, it's difficult to address them. Tuist
Insights provides you with the tools to monitor the health of your project and
maintain a productive developer environment as your project scales.

In other words, Tuist Insights helps you to anwer questions such as:
- Has the build time significantly increased in the last week?
- Have my tests become slower? Which ones?

Tuist Insights are in early development.

## Builds {#builds}

While you probably have some metrics for the performance of CI workflows, you
might not have the same visibility into the local development environment.
However, local build times are one of the most important factors that contribute
to the developer experience.

To start tracking local build times, you can leverage the `tuist inspect build`
command by adding it to your scheme's post-action:

![Post-action for inspecting
builds](/images/guides/features/insights/inspect-build-scheme-post-action.png)

::: info
<!-- -->
We recommend setting the "Provide build settings from" to the executable or your
main build target to enable Tuist to track the build configuration.
<!-- -->
:::

::: info
<!-- -->
If you are not using <LocalizedLink href="/guides/features/projects">generated
projects</LocalizedLink>, the post-scheme action is not executed in case the
build fails.
<!-- -->
:::
> 
> An undocumented feature in Xcode allows you to execute it even in this case.
> Set the attribute `runPostActionsOnFailure` to `YES` in your scheme's
> `BuildAction` in the relevant `project.pbxproj` file as follows:
> 
> ```diff
> <BuildAction
>    buildImplicitDependencies="YES"
>    parallelizeBuildables="YES"
> +  runPostActionsOnFailure="YES">
> ```

In case you're using [Mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/), your script will need to
activate `tuist` in the post-action environment:
```sh
# -C ensures that Mise loads the configuration from the Mise configuration
# file in the project's root directory.
$HOME/.local/bin/mise x -C $SRCROOT -- tuist inspect build
```

::: tip MISE & PROJECT PATHS Your environment's `PATH` environment variable is
not inherited by the scheme post action, and therefore you have to use Mise's
absolute path, which will depend on how you installed Mise. Moreover, don't
forget to inherit the build settings from a target in your project such that you
can run Mise from the directory pointed to by $SRCROOT. :::


Your local builds are now tracked as long as you are logged in to your Tuist
account. You can now access your build times in the Tuist dashboard and see how
they evolve over time:


::: tip
<!-- -->
To quickly access the dashboard, run `tuist project show --web` from the CLI.

## Сгенерированные проекты {#generated-projects}

::: info
<!-- -->
Auto-generated schemes automatically include the `tuist inspect build`
post-action.

If you are using generated projects, you can set up a custom
<LocalizedLink href="references/project-description/structs/buildaction#postactions">build
post-action</LocalizedLink> using a custom scheme, such as:

```swift
let project = Project(
    name: "MyProject",
    targets: [
        // Your targets
    ],
    schemes: [
        .scheme(
            name: "MyApp",
            shared: true,
            buildAction: .buildAction(
                targets: ["MyApp"],
                postActions: [
                    .executionAction(
                        title: "Inspect Build",
                        scriptText: """
                        eval \"$($HOME/.local/bin/mise activate -C $SRCROOT bash --shims)\"
                        tuist inspect build
                        """,
                        target: "MyApp"
                    )
                ],
                runPostActionsOnFailure: true
            ),
            testAction: .testAction(targets: ["MyAppTests"]),
            runAction: .runAction(configuration: "Debug")
        )
    ]
)
```

If you're not using Mise, your script can be simplified to just:

```swift
.postAction(
    name: "Inspect Build",
    script: "tuist inspect build",
    execution: .always
)
```

## Continuous integration {#continuous-integration}

To track build times also on the CI, you will need to ensure that your CI is
<LocalizedLink href="/guides/integrations/continuous-integration#authentication">authenticated</LocalizedLink>.

Additionally, you will either need to:
- Use the <LocalizedLink href="/cli/xcodebuild#tuist-xcodebuild">`tuist
  xcodebuild`</LocalizedLink> command when invoking `xcodebuild` actions.
- Add `-resultBundlePath` to your `xcodebuild` invocation.

When `xcodebuild` builds your project without `-resultBundlePath`, the
`.xcactivitylog` file is not generated. But the `tuist inspect build`
post-action requires that file to be generated to analyze your build.
