# Tuist

In the world of app development, particularly for platforms like Apple's, organizations often encounter **productivity roadblocks.** These can include sluggish compilation times, unreliable tests, and intricate automation workflows that drain resources. Traditionally, companies address these issues by forming dedicated platform teams. These specialists maintain codebase health and integrity, freeing other developers to focus on feature creation. However, this approach can be expensive and risky, as the departure of key team members can severely impact productivity.

**Tuist is a toolchain designed to accelerate and enhance app development.** We integrate seamlessly with official tools and systems, meeting developers in familiar territory. By shouldering the burden of tool and system integration, we enable teams to channel their energy into feature development and improving the overall developer experience. In essence, Tuist serves as your virtual platform team. We're with you every step of the way - from the spark of an app idea to its user launch - tackling challenges as they arise.

Tuist is comprised of **a [CLI](https://github.com/tuist/tuist)**, which is the main entry point for developers, and a server that the CLI integrates with to persist state and integrate with other publicly available services. Note that the features that require with the server might require a subscription.


## Why would I use Tuist?

Why choose Tuist? Here are compelling reasons:

- **Simplify modularization:** As projects grow and span multiple platforms, modularization becomes crucial. Tuist streamlines this complexity, offering tools to optimize and better understand your project's structure.
- **Optimize workflows:** Leveraging project information, Tuist enhances efficiency through selective test execution and deterministic binary reuse across builds.
- **Foster healthy project evolution:** We provide insights into your project's dynamics and expert guidance for informed decision-making. This approach prevents the frustration and productivity loss associated with unhealthy projects, which can lead to developer attrition and missed business goals.
- **Replace costly platform teams:** Instead of investing in expensive, potentially risky in-house platform teams, let Tuist be your virtual expert. We offer consistent support without the vulnerabilities of relying on key individuals.
- **Break down silos:** Unlike platform-specific ecosystems (e.g., Xcode's contained environment), Tuist offers web-centric experiences and integrates seamlessly with popular tools like Slack, Prometheus, and GitHub, enhancing cross-tool collaboration.
