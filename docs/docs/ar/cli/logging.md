# Logging {#logging}

The CLI logs messages internally to help you diagnose issues.

## Diagnose issues using logs {#diagnose-issues-using-logs}

If a command invocation doesn't yield the intended results, you can diagnose the
issue by inspecting the logs. The CLI forwards the logs to
[OSLog](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/os/oslog) and the file-system.

In every run, it creates a log file at `$XDG_STATE_HOME/tuist/logs/{uuid}.log`
where `$XDG_STATE_HOME` takes the value `~/.local/state` if the environment
variable is not set. You can also use `$TUIST_XDG_STATE_HOME` to set a
Tuist-specific state directory, which takes precedence over `$XDG_STATE_HOME`.

By default, the CLI outputs the logs path when the execution exits unexpectedly.
If it doesn't, you can find the logs in the path mentioned above (i.e., the most
recent log file).

### Continuous integration {#diagnose-issues-using-logs-ci}

In CI, where environments are disposable, you might want to configure your CI
pipeline to export Tuist logs. Exporting artifacts is a common capability across
CI services, and the configuration depends on the service you use. For example,
in GitHub Actions, you can use the `actions/upload-artifact` action to upload
the logs as an artifact:

```yaml
name: Node CI

on: [push]

env:
  TUIST_XDG_STATE_HOME: /tmp

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      # ... other steps
      - run: tuist generate
      # ... do something with the project
      - name: Export Tuist logs
        if: failure()
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: tuist-logs
          path: /tmp/tuist/logs/*.log
```

### Cache daemon debugging {#cache-daemon-debugging}

For debugging cache-related issues, Tuist logs cache daemon operations using
`os_log` with the subsystem `dev.tuist.cache`. You can stream these logs in
real-time using:

```bash
log stream --predicate 'subsystem == "dev.tuist.cache"' --debug
```

These logs are also visible in Console.app by filtering for the
`dev.tuist.cache` subsystem. This provides detailed information about cache
operations, which can help diagnose cache upload, download, and communication
issues.
