# Generated Projects Examples

In this section you'll find examples of
<LocalizedLink to="/guides/features/projects">generated projects</LocalizedLink>
which we use as
[fixtures](https://github.com/tuist/tuist/tree/main/cli/Fixtures) to run
acceptance tests against. You might find them useful when creating a new
generated project, or migrating an existing Xcode project to be generated by
Tuist.
