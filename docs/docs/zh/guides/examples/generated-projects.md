# Generated Projects Examples

In this section you'll find examples of <LocalizedLink to="/guides/features/projects">generated projects</LocalizedLink> which we use as [fixtures](https://github.com/tuist/tuist/tree/main/cli/Fixtures) to run acceptance tests against. You might find them useful when creating a new generated project, or migrating an existing Xcode project to be generated by Tuist.
