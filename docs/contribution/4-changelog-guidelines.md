# Changelog Guidelines

Here you can find the general guidelines for maintaining the Changelog (or adding new entry). We follow the guidelines from [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) with few additions.

## Guiding Principles

- Changelogs are for humans, not machines.
- There should be an entry for every single version.
- The same types of changes should be grouped.
- Versions and sections should be linkable.
- The latest version comes first.
- The release date of each versions is displayed.
- Mention whether you follow Semantic Versioning.
- Keep an unreleased section at the top.
- Add PR number and a GitHub tag at the end of each entry.
- Each breaking change entry should have **Breaking Change** label at the beginning of this entry.
- **Breaking Change** entries should be placed at the top of the section it's in.

## Types of changes

- **Added** for new features.
- **Changed** for changes in existing functionality.
- **Deprecated** for soon-to-be removed features.
- **Removed** for now removed features.
- **Fixed** for any bug fixes.
- **Security** in case of vulnerabilities.
