# Dependencies

**Setting up dependencies in Xcode projects isn't straightforward**. When dependencies have transitive dependencies things get complicated because it requires changes in the targets that are part of the branch where the transitive dependency is. To illustrate that, think about an app, depending on a dynamic framework `Search`, which has no dependencies. If at some point in the future we add a new dynamic framework `Core`, on which `Search` depends, well need to update not only `Search`, but the app to embed the framework into the product.

Imagine a modular app made of 8 projects, with at least two targets each of them \(to compile the framework/library and run the tests\), with dependencies between them. That's a very common setup in large projects, especially if you need to reuse code across different targets. With 16 targets to set up, **there's much knowledge that the developers need to keep in mind to do things the right way**. Who is depending on this target? Where do I need to embed this dynamic framework? Which build settings should I update to make the public interface of the library available?

Fortunately, **Tuist takes care of all that work for you**. It allows you to define dependencies and it uses that knowledge to set up the targets with the right build phases and build settings.  
If you noticed when we first introduced the manifest file, there isn't any public model for defining linking build phases. We made that on purpose because **we'd like to figure out all those things for you**.

## Defining dependencies

The `Target` model that we use from the manifest has a property, `dependencies`, that allows you to define the dependencies of the target.

```swift
let target = Target(
    dependencies: [

    ]
    /* Rest of the manifest*/
)
```

A dependency can be any of the following types.

## Target dependencies

```swift
.target("App")
```

It defines a dependency with another target in the same project. For instance, a tests target depends on the target that is being tested.

<Message
  info
  title="Tests host app"
  description="In order for an app to be the host target of a tests target, the app target should be added as a dependency."
/>

## Target dependencies across projects

```swift
.project(target: "Core", path: "../Core")
```

It defines a dependency with a target in another project. When the workspace gets generated, the other project is also included so that Xcode knows how to compile that other target.

## Framework dependencies

```swift
.framework(path: "Carthage/Build/iOS/Alamofire.framework")
```

It defines a dependency with a pre-compiled framework, for example, a framework that has been compiled by Carthage. If the framework contains multiple architectures, Tuist will add an extra build phase to strip them.

## Library dependencies

```swift
.library(path: "Vendor/Library.a",
         publicHeaders: nil,
         swiftModuleMap: "Vendor/Library.modulemap")
```

It defines a dependency with a pre-compiled library. It allows specifying the path where the public headers or Swift module map is.

## System libraries and frameworks dependencies

```swift
.sdk(name: "StoreKit.framework", status: .required)
```

```swift
.sdk(name: "ARKit.framework", status: .optional)
```

```swift
.sdk(name: "libc++.tbd")
```

It defines a dependency on a system library (`.tbd`) or framework (`.framework`) and optionally if it is `required` or `optional` (i.e. gets weakly linked).

## SPM dependencies

Targets can add Swift packages, either local packages or remote. You can add one very similarly to how you add dependencies in `Package.swift`.

For remote:

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/tuist/XcodeProj", productName: "xcodeproj", .exact("6.7.0"))
```

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/tuist/XcodeProj", productName: "xcodeproj", from: "6.7.0")
```

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/tuist/XcodeProj", productName: "xcodeproj", "6.6.1"..<"6.8.0")
```

For local:

```swift
.package(path: "MyLibrary", productName: "MyLibrary")
```

This also creates `.package.resolved`, so your team can share the same versions of dependencies without commiting your workspace.

## CocoaPods dependencies

Targets can indicate that they have [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org) dependencies defined in a `Podfile`:

```swift
.cocoapods(path: ".") // Expects a Podfile in the directory of the target's project
```

Tuist looks up CocoaPods using Bundler. If it's not defined, it falls back to the system's CocoaPods. If CocoaPods can't be found in the environment, the installation of the dependencies will fail.

<Message
  info
  title="Repository update"
  description="The underlying 'pod install' is executed with the '--update-repo' argument to ensure the local repository of pod specs is up to date."
/>
<Message
  warning
  title="Podfile validation"
  description="Tuist does not parse the CocoaPods dependency graph nor runs any validation. It's the user responsibility ensure the right format of the 'Podfile'."
/>

---

As we mentioned, the beauty of defining your dependencies with Tuist is that when you generate the project, things are set up and ready for you to successfully compile your targets.
