# Project.swift

Projects are defined in `Project.swift` files, which we refer to as manifest files. Manifests need to import the framework `ProjectDescription` which contains all the classes and enums that are available for you to describe your projects. The snippet below shows an example project manifest:

```swift

let project = Project(name: "MyProject",
                      targets: [
                          Target(name: "App",
                                 platform: .iOS,
                                 product: .app,
                                 bundleId: "io.tuist.App",
                                 infoPlist: "Config/App-Info.plist",
                                 sources: ["Sources/**"],
                                 resources: [
                                   "Resources/**",
                                   .folderReference(path: "Stubs")
                                  ],
                                 dependencies: [
                                     .project(target: "Framework1", path: "../Framework1"),
                                     .project(target: "Framework2", path: "../Framework2")
                                 ])
                        ],
                        schemes: [
                            Scheme(name: "App-Debug",
                                   shared: true,
                                   buildAction: BuildAction(targets: ["App"]),
                                   testAction: TestAction(targets: ["AppTests"]),
                                   runAction: RunAction(executable: "App")),
                            Scheme(name: "App-Release",
                                   shared: true,
                                   buildAction: BuildAction(targets: ["App"]),
                                   runAction: RunAction(executable: "App"))
                        ],
                        additionalFiles: [
                                 "Dangerfile.swift",
                                 "Documentation/**",
                                 .folderReference(path: "Website")
                        ])
```

## Project

A `Project.swift` should initialize a variable of type `Project`. It can take any name, although we recommend to stick to `project`. A project accepts the following attributes:

<PropertiesTable props={[
{
name: "Name",
description: "Name of the project. It's used to determine the name of the generated Xcode project.",
type: "String",
optional: false,
default: ""

]}/>

```swift
import ProjectDescription

let target = Target(name: "App",
                    platform: .iOS,
                    product: .app,
                    bundleId: "io.tuist.App",
                    infoPlist: "Info.plist",
                    sources: "Sources/**",
                    dependencies: [])
```

## Source file list

It represents a list of source files that are part of a target:

<PropertiesTable props={[
{
name: "Globs",
description: "Path to the source files. They represented by a glob pattern and the compiler flags.",
type: "[SourceFileGlob]",
typeLink: "#source-file-glob",
optional: false,
default: ""
}]}/>

<Message info title="ExpressibleByStringLiteral and ExpressibleByArrayLiteral" description="The list of source files can be initialized with a string that represents the glob pattern, or an array of strings, which represents a list of glob patterns. In both cases the comiler flags will have no value."/>

### Source file glob

It represents a glob pattern k

// TODO

## Headers

It represents the target headers:

<PropertiesTable props={[
{
name: "Public",
description: "Relative glob pattern that points to the public headers",
type: "String",
optional: true,
default: "nil"
},
{
name: "Private",
description: "Relative glob pattern that points to the private headers",
type: "String",
optional: true,
default: "nil"
},
{
name: "Project",
description: "Relative glob pattern that points to the project headers",
type: "String",
optional: true,
default: "nil"
},
]}/>

## Core Data Model

The `CoreDataModel` type represents a Core Data model:

<PropertiesTable props={[
{
name: "Path",
description: "Relative path to the Core Data model.",
type: "String",
optional: false,
default: ""
},
{
name: "Current version",
description: "Current version without the extension.",
type: "String",
optional: false,
default: ""
}
]}/>


## Platform

The platform type represents the platform a target is built for. It can be any of the following types:

<EnumTable cases={[
{
case: ".app",
description: "An application."
},
{
case: ".staticLibrary",
description: "A static library."
},
{
case: ".dynamicLibrary",
description: "A dynamic library."
},
{
case: ".framework",
description: "A dynamic framework."
},
{
case: ".staticFramework",
description: "A static framework. This is a regular framework product however is configured to be statically linked."
},
{
case: ".unitTests",
description: "A unit tests bundle."
},
{
case: ".uiTests",
description: "A UI tests bundle."
},
]}/>

## Target Action

Target actions, represented as target script build phases, are useful to define actions to be executed before of after the build process of a target. 

<EnumTable cases={[
{
case: ".pre(tool: String, arguments: String..., name: String)",
description: "Action executed before the target-specific build phases where tool is the name of the tool to be executed."
},
{
case: ".pre(name: String, arguments: String..., name: String)",
description: "Action executed before the target-specific build phases where path is the path to the tool to be executed."
},
{
case: ".post(tool: String, arguments: String..., name: String)",
description: "Action executed after all the target-specific build phases where tool is the name of the tool to be executed."
},
{
case: ".post(name: String, arguments: String..., name: String)",
description: "Action executed after all the target-specific build phases where path is the path to the tool to be executed."
},
]}/>

The following example shows the definition of an action that runs the `my_custom_script.sh` passing the argument `"hello"`:

```swift
.pre(path: "my_custom_script.sh", arguments: ["hello"], name: "My Custom Script Phase")
```


<Message info title="Relative paths" description="Either the tool or the path need to be defined. Moreover, Tuist verifies whether the launch path is valid and fail otherwise."/>

## Build Configuration

It represents the default build configurations available:

<EnumTable cases={[
{
case: ".debug",
description: "Debug build configuration, traditionally used during local development."
},
{
case: ".release",
description: "Release build configuration."
}
]}/>

## Scheme

A `Scheme` defines a collection of targets to `Build, Run, Test, Profile, Analyze and Archive`:

<PropertiesTable props={[
{
name: "Name",
description: "The name of the scheme.",
type: "String",
optional: false,
default: ""
},
{
name: "Shared",
description: "Marks the scheme as shared (i.e. one that is checked in to the repository and is visible to `xcodebuild` from the command line).",
type: "Bool",
optional: true,
default: "true"

name: "Base",
description: "A dictionary with build settings that are inherited from all the configurations.",
type: "[String: String]",
optional: true,
default: "[:]"
},

description: "An enum specifying the set of default settings.",
type: "DefaultSettings",
typeLink: "#defaultsettings",
optional: true,
default: ".recommended",
}
]}/>

## Configuration

A `Configuration` object describes the build settings and the `.xcconfig` file of a project or target. It is initialized with the following attributes:

<PropertiesTable props={[
{
name: "Settings",
description: "A dictionary that contains the build settings",
type: "[String: String]",
optional: true,
default: "[:]"
},
{

},
{
case: ".essential",

},
]}/>

<Message info title="Essential Settings" description="The `.essential` option can be used in the event all warnings are defined in an `xcconfig` file to prevent Tuist from overriding them at the project or target level."/>

# Workspace.swift

By default, `tuist generate` generates an Xcode workspace that has the same name as the current project. It includes the project and all its dependencies. Tuist allows customizing this behaviour by defining a workspace manifest within a `Workspace.swift` file.

Workspace manifests allow specifying a list of projects to generate and include in an Xcode workspace. Those projects don’t necessarily have to depend on one another.

Additionally, files and folder references (such as documentation files) can be included in a workspace manifest.

The snippet below shows an example workspace manifest:

```swift
import ProjectDescription

let workspace = Workspace(name: "CustomWorkspace",
                          projects: [
                            "App",
                            "Modules/**"
                          ],
                          additionalFiles: [
                            "Documentation/**",
                            .folderReference(path: "Website")
                          ])
```

A `Workspace.swift` file can reside in any directory (including a project directory).

## Workspace

A `Workspace.swift` should initialize a variable of type `Workspace`. It can take any name, although we recommend to stick to `workspace`. A workspace accepts the following attributes:

<PropertiesTable props={[
{
name: "Name",
description: "Name of the workspace. It’s used to determine the name of the generated Xcode workspace.",
type: "String",
optional: false,
default: ""
},
{
name: "Projects",
description: "List of paths (or glob patterns) to projects to generate and include within the generated Xcode workspace.",
type: "[String]",
optional: false,
default: ""
},
{
name: "AdditionalFiles",
description: "List of files to include in the workspace - these won't be included in any of the projects or their build phases.",
type: "[FileElement]",
typeLink: "#fileelement",
optional: true,
default: "[]"
},
]}/>

<Message info title="Relative paths" description="All the relative paths in the workspace manifest are relative to the folder that contains the manifest file."/>
