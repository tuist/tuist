## Project.swift

Projects are defined in `Project.swift` files, which we refer to as manifest files. Manifests need to import the framework `ProjectDescription` which contains all the classes and enums that are available for you to describe your projects. The snippet below shows an example project manifest:

```swift
let project = Project(name: "MyProject",
                      targets: [
                          Target(name: "App",
                                 platform: .iOS,
                                 product: .app,
                                 bundleId: "io.tuist.App",
                                 infoPlist: "Config/App-Info.plist",
                                 sources: ["Sources/**"],
                                 resources: [
                                   "Resources/**",
                                   .folderReference(path: "Stubs")
                                  ],
                                 dependencies: [
                                     .project(target: "Framework1", path: "../Framework1"),
                                     .project(target: "Framework2", path: "../Framework2")
                                 ])
                        ],
                        additionalFiles: [
                                 "Dangerfile.swift",
                                 "Documentation/**",
                                 .folderReference(path: "Website")
                        ])
```

### Project

A `Project.swift` should initialize a variable of type `Project`. It can take any name, although we recommend to stick to `project`. A project accepts the following attributes:

<PropertiesTable props={[
{
name: "Name",
description: "Name of the project. It's used to determine the name of the generated Xcode project.",
type: "String",
optional: false,
default: ""
},
{
name: "Targets",
description: "Name of the project. It's used to determine the name of the generated Xcode project.",
type: "[Target]",
typeLink: "#target",
optional: false,
default: "[]"
},
{
name: "Settings",
description: "Project build settings and configuration files",
type: "Settings",
typeLink: "#settings",
optional: true,
default: ""
},
{
name: "AdditionalFiles",
description: "List of files to include in the project - these won't be included in any of the build phases",
type: "[FileElement]",
typeLink: "#fileelement",
optional: true,
default: "[]"
}
]}/>

<Message info title="Relative paths" description="All the relative paths in the project manifest are relative to the folder that contains the manifest file."/>

### Target

Each target in the list of project targets can be initialized with the following attributes:

<PropertiesTable props={[
{
name: "Name",
description: "The name of the target. The Xcode project target and the derivated product take the same name.",
type: "String",
optional: false,
default: ""
},
{
name: "Platform",
description: "The platform the target product is built for.",
type: "Platform",
typeLink: "#platform",
optional: false,
default: ""
},
{
name: "Bundle id",
description: "The product bundle identifier.",
type: "String",
optional: false,
default: ""
},
{

description: "Relative path to the Info.plist",
type: "String",
optional: false,
default: ""
},
{
name: "Resources",
description: "List of files to include in the resources build phase",
type: "[FileElement]",
typeLink: "#fileelement",
optional: true,
default: "[]"
},
{
name: "Headers",
description: "The target headers",
type: "Headers",
typeLink: "#headers",
optional: true,
default: "nil"
},
{
name: "Entitlements",
description: "Path to the entitlement file.",
type: "String",
optional: true,
default: "nil"
},
{
name: "Actions",
description: "Target actions allow defining extra script build phases.",
type: "[TargetAction]",
typeLink: "#target-action",
optional: true,
default: "[]"
},
{
name: "Dependencies",
description: "List of target dependencies",
type: "[TargetDependency]",
typeLink: "./usage-3-dependencies",
optional: true,
default: "[]"
},
{
name: "Settings",
description: "Target build settings and configuration files.",
type: "Settings",
typeLink: "#settings",
optional: true,
default: "nil"
},
{
name: "Core Data models",
description: "Core Data models.",
type: "[CoreDataModel]",
typeLink: "#core-data-model",
optional: true,
default: "[]"
},
{
name: "Environment",
description: "List of variables that will be set to the scheme that Tuist automatically generates for the target.",
type: "[String: String]",
optional: true,
default: "[:]"
},
]}/>

- **Sources:** List of sources to be compiled by the target. The attribute can be any of the following types:
  - **String:** A file or glob pattern _(e.g. `Sources/**`)_
  - **[String]:** A list of files or list of glob patterns _(e.g. `["Sources/**"]`)_

### Headers

It represents the target headers:

<PropertiesTable props={[
{
name: "Public",
description: "Relative glob pattern that points to the public headers",
type: "String",
optional: true,
default: "nil"
},
{
name: "Private",
description: "Relative glob pattern that points to the private headers",
type: "String",
optional: true,
default: "nil"
},
{
name: "Project",
description: "Relative glob pattern that points to the project headers",
type: "String",
optional: true,
default: "nil"
},
]}/>

### Core Data Model

The `CoreDataModel` type represents a Core Data model:

<PropertiesTable props={[
{
name: "Path",
description: "Relative path to the Core Data model.",
type: "String",
optional: false,
default: ""
},
{
name: "Current version",
description: "Current version without the extension.",
type: "String",
optional: false,
default: ""
}
]}/>


### Platform

The platform type represents the platform a target is built for. It can be any of the following types:

<EnumTable cases={[
{
case: ".app",
description: "An application."
},
{
case: ".staticLibrary",
description: "A static library."
},
{
case: ".dynamicLibrary",
description: "A dynamic library."
},
{
case: ".framework",
description: "A dynamic framework."
},
{
case: ".staticFramework",
description: "A static framework. This is a regular framework product however is configured to be statically linked."
},
{
case: ".unitTests",
description: "A unit tests bundle."
},
{
case: ".uiTests",
description: "A UI tests bundle."
},
]}/>

### Target Action

Target actions, represented as target script build phases, are useful to define actions to be executed before of after the build process of a target. 

<EnumTable cases={[
{
case: ".pre(tool: String, arguments: String..., name: String)",
description: "Action executed before the target-specific build phases where tool is the name of the tool to be executed."
},
{
case: ".pre(name: String, arguments: String..., name: String)",
description: "Action executed before the target-specific build phases where path is the path to the tool to be executed."
},
{
case: ".post(tool: String, arguments: String..., name: String)",
description: "Action executed after all the target-specific build phases where tool is the name of the tool to be executed."
},
{
case: ".post(name: String, arguments: String..., name: String)",
description: "Action executed after all the target-specific build phases where path is the path to the tool to be executed."
},
]}/>

The following example shows the definition of an action that runs the `my_custom_script.sh` passing the argument `"hello"`:

```swift
.pre(path: "my_custom_script.sh", arguments: ["hello"], name: "My Custom Script Phase")
```


<Message info title="Relative paths" description="Either the tool or the path need to be defined. Moreover, Tuist verifies whether the launch path is valid and fail otherwise."/>

### Settings

A `Settings` object contains an optional dictionary with build settings and relative path to an `.xcconfig` file. It is initialized with the following attributes:

<PropertiesTable props={[
{
name: "Base",
description: "A dictionary with build settings that are inherited from all the configurations.",
type: "[String: String]",
optional: true,
default: "[:]"
},
{
name: "Debug",
description: "The debug configuration settings.",
type: "Configuration",
typeLink: "#configuration",
optional: true,
default: "",
},
{
name: "Release",
description: "Same as debug but for the release configuration.",
type: "Configuration",
typeLink: "#configuration",
optional: true,
default: "",
}
]}/>

### Configuration

A `Configuration` object describes the build settings and the `.xcconfig` file of a project or target. It is initialized with the following attributes:

<PropertiesTable props={[
{
name: "Settings",
description: "A dictionary that contains the build settings",
type: "[String: String]",
optional: true,
default: "[:]"
},
{
name: "Xcconfig",
description: "The path to the xcconfig file",
type: "String",
optional: true,
default: ""
},
]}/>

### FileElement

A `FileElement` can be one of the following options:

<EnumTable cases={[
{
case: ".glob(pattern: String)",
description: "A file path (or glob pattern) to include. For convenience, a string literal can be used as an alternate way to specify this option."
},
{
case: ".folderReference(path: String)",
description: "A directory path to include as a folder reference."
}
]}/>

## Workspace.swift

By default, `tuist generate` generates an Xcode workspace that has the same name as the current project. It includes the project and all its dependencies. Tuist allows customizing this behaviour by defining a workspace manifest within a `Workspace.swift` file.

Workspace manifests allow specifying a list of projects to generate and include in an Xcode workspace. Those projects donâ€™t necessarily have to depend on one another.

Additionally, files and folder references (such as documentation files) can be included in a workspace manifest.

The snippet below shows an example workspace manifest:

```swift
import ProjectDescription

let workspace = Workspace(name: "CustomWorkspace",
                          projects: [
                            "App",
                            "Modules/**"
                          ],
                          additionalFiles: [
                            "Documentation/**",
                            .folderReference(path: "Website")
                          ])
```

A `Workspace.swift` file can reside in any directory (including a project directory).

### Workspace

A `Workspace.swift` should initialize a variable of type `Workspace`. It can take any name, although we recommend to stick to `workspace`. A workspace accepts the following attributes:

<PropertiesTable props={[
{
name: "Name",
description: "Name of the workspace. Itâ€™s used to determine the name of the generated Xcode workspace.",
type: "String",
optional: false,
default: ""
},
{
name: "Projects",
description: "List of paths (or glob patterns) to projects to generate and include within the generated Xcode workspace.",
type: "[String]",
optional: false,
default: ""
},
{
name: "AdditionalFiles",
description: "List of files to include in the workspace - these won't be included in any of the projects or their build phases.",
type: "[FileElement]",
typeLink: "#fileelement",
optional: true,
default: "[]"
},
]}/>

<Message info title="Relative paths" description="All the relative paths in the workspace manifest are relative to the folder that contains the manifest file."/>
