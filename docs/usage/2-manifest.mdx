## Project.swift

Projects are defined in `Project.swift` files, which we refer to as manifest files. Manifests need to import the framework `ProjectDescription` which contains all the classes and enums that are available for you to describe your projects. The snippet below shows an example project manifest:

```swift

let project = Project(name: "MyProject",
                      targets: [
                          Target(name: "App",
                                 platform: .iOS,
                                 product: .app,
                                 bundleId: "io.tuist.App",
                                 infoPlist: "Config/App-Info.plist",
                                 sources: ["Sources/**"],
                                 resources: [
                                   "Resources/**",
                                   .folderReference(path: "Stubs")
                                  ],
                                 dependencies: [
                                     .project(target: "Framework1", path: "../Framework1"),
                                     .project(target: "Framework2", path: "../Framework2")
                                 ])
                        ],
                        schemes: [
                            Scheme(name: "App-Debug",
                                   shared: true,
                                   buildAction: BuildAction(targets: ["App"]),
                                   testAction: TestAction(targets: ["AppTests"]),
                                   runAction: RunAction(executable: "App")),
                            Scheme(name: "App-Release",
                                   shared: true,
                                   buildAction: BuildAction(targets: ["App"]),
                                   runAction: RunAction(executable: "App"))
                        ],
                        additionalFiles: [
                                 "Dangerfile.swift",
                                 "Documentation/**",
                                 .folderReference(path: "Website")
                        ])
```

### Project

A `Project.swift` should initialize a variable of type `Project`. It can take any name, although we recommend to stick to `project`. A project accepts the following attributes:

<PropertiesTable props={[
{
name: "Name",
description: "Name of the project. It's used to determine the name of the generated Xcode project.",
type: "String",
optional: false,
default: ""
},
{
name: "Targets",
description: "Name of the project. It's used to determine the name of the generated Xcode project.",
type: "[Target]",
typeLink: "#target",
optional: false,
default: "[]"
},
{
name: "Schemes",
description: "List of files to include in the project - these won't be included in any of the build phases",
type: "[Scheme]",
typeLink: "#scheme",
optional: true,
default: "[]"
},
{
name: "Settings",
description: "Project build settings and configuration files",
type: "Settings",
typeLink: "#settings",
optional: true,
default: ""
},
{
name: "AdditionalFiles",
description: "List of files to include in the project - these won't be included in any of the build phases",
type: "[FileElement]",
typeLink: "#fileelement",
optional: true,
default: "[]"
}
]}/>

<Message info title="Relative paths" description="All the relative paths in the project manifest are relative to the folder that contains the manifest file."/>

### Target

Each target in the list of project targets can be initialized with the following attributes:

- **Name:** The name of the target. The Xcode project target and the derivated product take the same name.
- **Platform:** The platform the target product is built for. The following products are supported:
  - **.app:** An application
  - **.staticLibrary:** A static library.
  - **.dynamicLibrary:** A dynamic library.
  - **.framework:** A dynamic framework.
  - **.staticFramework:** A static framework. This is a regular framework product however is configured to be statically linked.
  - **.unitTests:** A unit tests bundle.
  - **.uiTests:** A UI tests bundle.
- **BundleID:** The product bundle identifier.
- **InfoPlist:** Relative path to the `Info.plist`.
- **Sources:** List of sources to be compiled by the target. The attribute can be any of the following types:
  - **String:** A file or glob pattern _(e.g. `Sources/**`)_
  - **[String]:** A list of files or list of glob patterns _(e.g. `["Sources/**"]`)_
- **Resources (optional):** List of [FileElement](#FileElement)s to include in the resource build phase.
- **Headers (optional):** Target headers. It accepts a `Header` type that is initialized with the following attributes:
  - **Public:** Relative path or glob pattern to the public headers _(e.g. `Sources/Public/**`)_
  - **Private:** Relative path or glob pattern to the private headers _(e.g. `Sources/Private/**`)_
  - **Project:** Relative path or glob pattern to the project headers _(e.g. `Sources/Project/**`)_
- **Entitlements (optional):** Relative path to the entitlements file.
- **Actions (optional):** Target actions allow defining extra script build phases. It's an array of `TargetAction` objects that that can be of type `pre` and `post`:
  - **pre:** Executed before the target-specific build phases.
  - **post:** Executed after the target-specific build phases.
  - Actions of both types can be initialized with:
    - **tool (optional):** The binary to use to execute the build phase.
    - **path (optional):** Path to the script to execute.
    - **arguments:** Path to the script to execute.
    - **name:** The name of the build phase

```swift
.pre(path: "my_custom_script.sh", arguments: ["hello"], name: "My Custom Script Phase")
```

> Note: Either the tool or the path need to be defined. Moreover, Tuist verifies whether the launch path is valid and fail otherwise.

- **Dependencies (optional):** You can read more about dependencies [here](./dependencies.md)
- **Settings (optional):** Read more about [settings](#settings)
- **CoreDataModels (optional):** An array of `CoreDataModel` objects. A `CoreDataModel` is an special type of resource that requires the following two attributes:
  - **Path:** Relative path to the Core Data model.
  - **CurrentVersion:** Current version without the extension.
- **Environment (optional):** It's a `[String: String]` to defined variables that will be set to the scheme that Tuist automatically generates for the target.

### Scheme

A `Scheme` defines a collection of targets to `Build, Run, Test, Profile, Analyze and Archive`:

> Note: Tuist will auto-generate a scheme for each target by default in addition to any defined schemes.

- **name: String:** Name of Scheme.
- **shared: Bool:** Marks the scheme as shared (i.e. one that is checked in to the repository and is visible to `xcodebuild` from the command line).
- **buildAction: BuildAction?:** Scheme Build options.
    - **targets: [String]:** A list of targets to build, which are defined in the Project.
    - **preActions:[ [ExecutionAction](#execution-action)]:** A list of pre build actions.
    - **postActions: [[ExecutionAction](#execution-action)]:** A list of post build actions.
- **testAction: TestAction?:** Scheme Test options.
    - **targets: [String]:** A list of targets to test, which are defined in the Project.
    - **arguments: [Arguments?](#arguments):** Commandline arguments passed on launch and Environment variables.
    - **config: BuildConfiguration:** Test with  `debug` or `release` configuration.
    - **coverage: Bool:** Scheme should gather coverage data or not. Default is `false`.
    - **preActions: [[ExecutionAction](#execution-action)]:** Pre test script action.
    - **postActions: [[ExecutionAction](#execution-action)]:** Post test script action.
- **runAction: RunAction?:** Run or Launch action.
    - **config: BuildConfiguration:** Run with `debug` or `release` configuration.
    - **executable: String?:** Executable or target to launch.
    - **arguments: [Arguments?](#arguments):** Commandline arguments passed on launch and Environment variables
    
#### Execution Action
Scheme run scripts can be defined with the following attributes:
- **title: String:** Name of a script. Defaults to `Run Script`.
- **scriptText: String:** An inline shell script.
- **target: String?:** Name of the build or test target that will provide the action's build settings.

#### Arguments
Arguments contain commandline arguments passed on launch and Environment variables.
- **environment: [String: String]:** Environment variables.
- **launch: [String: Bool]:** Commandline launch arguments where the `key` is a launch argument and the `value` is a boolean indicating if it's enabled.

### Settings

A `Settings` object contains an optional dictionary with build settings and relative path to an `.xcconfig` file. It is initialized with the following attributes:

- **Base (optional):** A `[String: String]` with build settings that are inherited from all the configurations.
- **Debug (optional):** The debug configuration settings. The settings are initialized with `.settings([String: String], xcconfig: String)` where the first argument are the build settings and the second a relative path to an xcconfig file. Both arguments are optionals.
- **Release (optional):** Same as debug but for the release configuration.

### FileElement

A `FileElement` can be one of the following options:

- `.glob(pattern: String)`: A file path (or glob pattern) to include.
  - _For convenience, a string literal can be used as an alternate way to specify this option._
- `.folderReference(path: String)`: A directory path to include as a folder reference.

## Workspace.swift

By default, `tuist generate` generates an Xcode workspace that has the same name as the current project. It includes the project and all its dependencies. Tuist allows customizing this behaviour by defining a workspace manifest within a `Workspace.swift` file.

Workspace manifests allow specifying a list of projects to generate and include in an Xcode workspace. Those projects don’t necessarily have to depend on one another.

Additionally, files and folder references (such as documentation files) can be included in a workspace manifest.

The snippet below shows an example workspace manifest:

```swift
import ProjectDescription

let workspace = Workspace(name: "CustomWorkspace",
                          projects: [
                            "App",
                            "Modules/**"
                          ],
                          additionalFiles: [
                            "Documentation/**",
                            .folderReference(path: "Website")
                          ])
```

A `Workspace.swift` file can reside in any directory (including a project directory).

### Workspace

A `Workspace.swift` should initialize a variable of type `Workspace`. It can take any name, although we recommend to stick to `workspace`. A workspace accepts the following attributes:

- **Name:** Name of the workspace. It’s used to determine the name of the generated Xcode workspace.
- **Projects:** List of paths (or glob patterns) to projects to generate and include within the generated Xcode workspace.
- **AdditionalFiles (optional):**: List of [FileElement](#FileElement)s to include in the workspace - these won't be included in any of the projects or their build phases.

> **_Note:_**All the relative paths in the workspace manifest are relative to the folder that contains the manifest file.\*
