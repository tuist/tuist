The following list contains all the documentation for people that are interested in contributed to the project. They get updated as the project evolves so even if you are already a contributor, we'd recommend you to revisit them once in a while:

- [Code of conduct](contribution/code-of-conduct.md): Needless to say, you should be a nice developer, have a good conduct and reject any unacceptable behavior from you or any member of the project.
- [Changelog guidelines](contribution/changelog-guidelines.md) - Changes to the project are reflected in the project `CHANGELOG.md` file. This document contains some guidelines the file adheres to.
- [Core team](contribution/core-team.md): The Tuist Core team is a group of contributors that have demonstrated a lasting enthusiasm for the project and community. You can read more about their responsibilities and get to know the team.
