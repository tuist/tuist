## For contributors/maintainers 📚

The following list contains all the documentation for people that are interested in contributed to the project. They get updated as the project evolves so even if you are already a contributor, we'd recommend you to revisit them once in a while:

- [Getting started as a contributor](contribution/getting-started.md): Are you new to contributing to the project? You'll find some recommendations to start from.
- [Code of conduct](contribution/code-of-conduct.md): Needless to say, you should be a nice developer, have a good conduct and reject any unacceptable behavior from you or any member of the project.
- [Changelog guidelines](contribution/changelog-guidelines.md) - Changes to the project are reflected in the project `CHANGELOG.md` file. This document contains some guidelines the file adheres to.
- [Core team](contribution/core-team.md):
- [Zen principles](contribution/zen.md): A set of principles on which maintainers and contributors base their decisions.
