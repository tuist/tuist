# Atlas iOS

SwiftUI owns presentation; Rust owns OAuth and allowlisted Automation networking.
Keep shared section strings/routes in the Rust navigation catalog. Do not add a web
view, source interpreter or independent networking/token-refresh implementation.

`AtlasAuthentication` is the MainActor coordinator for credential mutation and shared
in-flight refresh. Persist rotations before requests, fence both successes and errors
by session generation, and discard cancelled/late responses. Blocking Rust calls run
on a GCD background queue, not the UI thread or Swift's cooperative executor. Keychain
contains opaque sessions and unconfirmed launch payloads; never log either.

Automation uses Workflows, Activity and Approvals. Forms bind reviewed revision/input
and stable request IDs; malformed/unsupported schemas must offer web fallback. Required
objects survive omitted optional children; false, zero and absence are different.
Explicit approval confirmation displays the exact persisted payload. Navigate only
after the launch review sheet dismisses. Results are separate protected reads.

Execution subscriptions run only in an active scene. Reconnect from authoritative
state, retain monotonic sequences, fall back to HTTP when WebSockets fail, and clear
inaccessible data after revocation. Backgrounding must not cancel the durable run.
Automation has no Live Activity or background execution/approval notification integration;
the separate native push coordinator supports APNs for other fixed notification kinds.

Add new Swift sources to explicit Once source lists where needed, particularly the
unhosted test bundle. Run `once build AtlasIOS`, `once test AtlasIOSTests` and
`once lint AtlasSwiftLint` through Mise with local caching. Tests use Swift Testing
and per-test storage adapters, not global credential/environment mutation.
