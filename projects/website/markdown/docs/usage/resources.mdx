# Accessing resources

Depending on the target product (e.g. app, framework), resources are accessed differently.
For example, if we are trying to get an image that is part of an app target, we get the image from the `Bundle.main`.
Conversely, if the image is part of a framework, we access it from the `Bundle` that represents the framework, `Bundle(for: FrameworkClass.self).resourceURL`.
Having an **inconsistent interface** for accessing resources complicates moving code and resources around.

Moreover,
as you might know,
libraries can't contain resources - only frameworks can.
On iOS,
this often leads projects to use dynamic frameworks instead of static libraries,
and in some cases,
add custom build phases that copy resources from dependencies into the final product (app).
Resorting to this setup is not ideal because it introduces side effects, complicates the maintenance of the project, and makes the setup hard to reason about.

## A consistent way for accessing resources

Tuist solves this by generating a `Bundle` extension for accessing the right bundle depending on the type of target.
For example, given a target framework `MyFeature`, you'll be able to get the right bundle with:

```swift
let bundle = Bundle.module
```

Furthermore, we support defining resources in products that don't support it (e.g. libraries). For those, we generate an associated bundle target (e.g. `MyFeatureResources.bundle`) that contains all the resources. The bundle ends up being copied into the final product bundle that contains compiled target.

### Objective-C

Tuist also synthesizes accessors for Objective-C.
In this case, the Bundle needs to be accessed using the target name to avoid name conflicts:

```objectivec
NSBundle *bundle = [MyFeatureResources bundle];
```

## Synthesized Resource Interface Accessors

Accessing images, strings and other resources with String-based APIs gets messy real fast, which is why lots of teams
have opted to use [SwiftGen](https://github.com/SwiftGen/SwiftGen) or some other code generator.

This is why we think it is a great opportunity to integrate [SwiftGen](https://github.com/SwiftGen/SwiftGen) into tuist,
so teams can use it out of the box without having to set it up themselves!

So, how does one synthesize the resource interface accessors? It's simple, you just add `resources` to your `Target`
and the rest is done for you.

It generates code that uses tuist's aforementioned bundle accessor, so you can use it safely in your libraries, too.

Currently, we support these types of resources with the following interface names and files:

- Assets (images and colors) {TargetName}Assets `Assets+{TargetName}.swift`
- Strings {TargetName}Assets `Strings+{TargetName}.swift`
- Plists {NameOfPlist} `{NameOfPlist}.swift`
- Fonts `Fonts+{TargetName}.swift`

So, for example if you have a target `MyFramework` with the following resources:

- Assets.xcassets
  - image1
  - image2
- Environment.plist
  - myKey
- Fonts
  - SF-Pro-Display-Bold.otf
  - SF-Pro-Display-Heavy.otf

```swift
// Accessing Asset Catalog Images
let image1 = MyFrameworkAssets.myImage1
let image2 = MyFrameworkAssets.myImage2

// Accessing Plist Key values
let myKeyValue = Environment.myKey

// Accessing Fonts
let sfProBoldFont = MyFrameworkFontFamily.SFProDisplay.bold
let sfProHeavyFont = MyFrameworkFontFamily.SFProDisplay.heavy
```

To ensure that it works well with our cache feature, it's not possible to run it from a build path.

You can also opt out of this feature by adding `disableSynthesizedResourceAccessors` to `generationOptions` in `Config.swift`
