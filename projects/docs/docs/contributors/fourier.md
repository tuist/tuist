Fourier is Tuist's CLI tool to automate development tasks with the goal of **easing the contributions to the project**.

Before Fourier's existence, Tuist used [Ruby's Rake](https://github.com/ruby/rake). Rake's approach to designing the CLI interface leads to a flat and non-standard interface that doesn't support the usage of arguments to customize workflows. For instance, the following command is not possible `./bin/rake test --unit` and has to be `./bin/test_unit` instead. This often leads to a non-conventional naming across tasks (e.g. `test_unit`, `run_acceptance_tests`, `test_all`), and a huge `Rakefile` that contains the parsing code and the business logic all together.

By implementing our CLI tool within the repository we can better ensure the interface is consistent, and that the business logic is well-structured and tested.

## Running Fourier

Before running Fourier, make sure that you have the Ruby version specified in the `.ruby-version` file, and that you have fetched the [Bundler](https://bundler.io) dependencies specified in the `Gemfile` by running `bundle install`. Then, you can run the following command:

```bash
./fourier --help
```

It'll output the list of available commands that you can run.

## Shadowenv

Tuist includes [Shadowenv](https://shopify.github.io/shadowenv/) directory to adjust your local environment as you enter Tuist's directory from an interactive shell. One of the environment configurations that we provide is exposing the `bin/` directory to your path. Thanks to that, you can run Fourier by simply running `fourier` in your terminal.

If you don't have Shadowenv installed locally, you can follow [these steps](https://shopify.github.io/shadowenv/getting-started/#installation).
