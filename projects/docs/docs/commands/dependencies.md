Tuist provides a first-class support for integrating external dependencies into your projects. External dependencies [are declared](guides/third-party-dependencies.md) in a `Tuist/Dependencies.swift` file, and through the commands described in this page you can **fetch, update, and clean** dependencies in your project's directory. Tuist integrates them automatically when generating the Xcode projects.

### Commands

#### Fetching

Dependencies can be fetched by running the following command. They are stored in your project's `Tuist/Dependencies` directory:

```bash
tuist fetch dependencies
