### Graph

When projects grow, it becomes hard to visualize the dependencies between all the targets that are part of the project.
Fortunately, Tuist provides a command, `tuist graph`, that loads your project dependencies graph and exports it. As the
saying goes, "one image is worth a thousand words":

The command will output the dependency graph as an image, in the `png` format.
You can also change the format to `dot` (see [DOT](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOT_(graph_description_language)>))
to get the raw contents of the graph.

### Command

Run the following command from a directory that contains a workspace or project manifest:

```bash
tuist graph
```

If you prefer to have the dot representation of the graph and render it separately, you can run:

```bash
tuist graph --format dot
```

To show the graph of only specific targets and their dependencies, you can run:

```
tuist graph FrameworkA FrameworkB
```

#### Legend

The graph command will style every type of target or dependency differently. This makes it easier to understand
and visualize the graph. App targets, swift packages, frameworks, and all other types will have different shapes and colors.
To better understand what which one means, you can use the following legend as a reference.

If you prefer the old style, without different colors and shapes, pass the `--simple` flag when creating the graph.
