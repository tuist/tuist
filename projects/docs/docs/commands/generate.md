### Context

Project generation is one of Tuist's core features.
It loads your project's dependency graph by reading the manifest files _(e.g. Project.swift, Workspace.swift)_, and translates it into
Xcode projects and workspaces.
You can think of manifest files as an simple and approachable abstraction of Xcode projects' intricacies,
and Xcode projects and workspaces as a implementation detail to edit your project's code.

### Command

To generate the project in the current directory, youn can simply run:

```
tuist generate
```

The command accepts the `--path` argument, which can be used to generate the project in a different directory.

There might be situations when you are only interested in generating the project in a given directory, and not the projects it depends on. For that, you can pass the argument `--project-only`.

### Arguments
