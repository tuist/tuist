description: "Learn how to use Tuist's clean command to clean local data generated by Tuist for your projects"
---

Some Tuist features store local state that persists across runs.
For example, `tuist generate` stores an intermediate representation of your projects to speed up the generation of projects.

To clean all the data generated by Tuist, you can use the following command:

```
tuist clean
```

To clean only a subset of the data generated by Tuist, you can specify the categories to be deleted, for example:

```
tuist clean manifests tests
```
