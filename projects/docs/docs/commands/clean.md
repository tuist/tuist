---

Some Tuist features store local state that persists across runs.
For example, `tuist generate` stores an intermediate representation of your projects to speed up the generation of projects.

To clean all the data generated by Tuist, you can use the following command:

```
tuist clean
```

To clean only a subset of the data generated by Tuist, you can specify the categories to be deleted, for example:

```
tuist clean manifests tests
```

The list of supported categories is:
 - plugins: the plugins cache
 - builds: the builds artifacts cache
 - tests: the tests cache
 - generatedAutomationProjects: the automation projects cache
 - projectDescriptionHelpers: the project description helpers cache
 - manifests: the manifests cache
