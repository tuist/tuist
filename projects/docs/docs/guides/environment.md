There are certain scenarios where you might need to customize the projects at generation time. For example, if you are building a white-label app, you might want to use the same project structure, but adjust some attributes in a per-app basis. For example, the name of the app.

To facilitate that, Tuist allows passing configuration through environment variables that can be accessed from the manifest files. For example:

```bash
TUIST_APP_NAME=MyApp tuist focus
```

If you want to pass multiple environment variables just separate them with a space. For example:

```bash
TUIST_APP_NAME=MyApp TUIST_APP_LOCALE=pl tuist focus
```

Variables can be accesed using the `Environment` type. Any variables following the convention `TUIST_XXX` defined in the environment or passed to Tuist when running commands will be accessible using the `Environment` type.
The following example shows how we access the `TUIST_APP_NAME` variable:

```swift
func appName() -> String {
    if case let .string(environmentAppName) = Environment.appName {
        return environmentAppName
    } else {
        return "MyApp"
    }
}
```

Accessing variables returns an instance of type `Environment.Value?` which can take any of the following values:

<EnumTable
cases={[
{
case: '.boolean',
description:
'Used when the variable represents a boolean. The values 1, true, TRUE, yes and YES are casted to `true`, and 0, false, FALSE, no, and NO are casted to `false`',
},
{
case: '.string',
description: 'Used when the variable represents a string.',
},
]}
/>

You can also retrieve the string or boolean Environment variable using either of the helper methods defined below, these methods require a default value to be passed to ensure the user gets consistent results each time. This avoids the need to define the function appName() defined above.

```swift
Environment.appName.getString(default: "TuistApp")
```

```swift
Environment.isCI.getBoolean(default: false)
```
