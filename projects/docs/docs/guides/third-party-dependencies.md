# Dependencies.swift

Learn how to define the contract between the dependency managers (Cocoapods, Carthage and SPM) and Tuist.

## Integration status

- âœ… Carthage
- ðŸš§ Swift Package Manager
- ðŸ”´ Cocoapods

## How to get started

### Step 1: "Dependencies.swift"

1. Create `Dependencies.swift` in your project in `Tuist/` directory.
2. You can read more about `Dependencies.swift` [here](/manifests/dependencies/).
3. Run `tuist edit` to start editing your manifest files.
4. Add `import ProjectDescription` on the top of file.
5. Define your dependencies.

Example of project structure with added `Depedencies.swift` manifest file:

```bash
AwesomeProject
	|- App
	|- AppTests
	|- Tuist
		|- Dependencies.swift
	|- Project.swift
```

The snippet below shows an example `Dependencies.swift` manifest file:

```swift
import ProjectDescription

let dependencies = Dependencies(
    carthage: .carthage(
        [
            .github(path: "Alamofire/Alamofire", requirement: .exact("5.0.4"))
        ],
        options: [.useXCFrameworks, .noUseBinaries]
    ),
    swiftPackageManager: nil, // work in progress, pass `nil`
    platforms: [.iOS]
)
```

### Step 2: "tuist dependencies" commands

1. Pull dependencies using `tuist dependencies fetch` command.
2. You can read more about commands [here](/commands/dependencies/).
3. Tuist will save dependencies in `/Tuist/Dependencies` directory.

The folder structure below shows how Tuist organizes dependencies:

```bash
Tuist
    |- Dependencies.swift # Manifest
    |- Dependencies
        |- graph.json # coming soon
        |- Lockfiles
            |- Carthage.resolved
            |- Package.resolved
            |- Podfile.lock # coming soon
        |- Carthage # stores content of `Carthage/Build` directory generated by `Carthage`
            |- Alamofire.xcframework
        |- SwiftPackageManager # stores content of `.build/` directory generated by `Swift Package Manager`
            |- artifacts
            |- checkouts
            |- repositories
            |- manifest.db
            |- workspace-state.json
        |- Cocoapods # coming soon
            |- RxSwift
```

If you don't want to check in build artifacts you can update your `.gitignore`:

```bash
# Add this line if you want to avoid checking in a build artifacts from Carthage dependencies.
Tuist/Dependencies/Carthage

# Add this line if you want to avoid checking in a build artifacts from Swift Package Manager dependencies.
Tuist/Dependencies/SwiftPackageManager

# Add this line if you want to avoid checking in a build artifacts from CocoaPods dependencies.
Tuist/Dependencies/Cocoapods
```

### Step 3: Link dependencies

Link pulled dependencies in your project manifest file.

1. Run `tuist edit` to start editing your manifest files.
2. Open `Project.swift`.
3. Define your project with dependencies.

The snippet below shows an example `Project.swift` manifest file:

```swift
import ProjectDescription

let project = Project(
    name: "App",
    organizationName: "tuist.io",
    targets: [
        Target(
            name: "App",
            platform: .iOS,
            product: .app,
            bundleId: "io.tuist.app",
            deploymentTarget: .iOS(targetVersion: "13.0", devices: .iphone),
            infoPlist: .default,
            sources: ["Targets/App/Sources/**"],
            dependencies: [
                .xcFramework("Tuist/Dependencies/Carthage/Alamofire.xcframework"),
            ]
        ),
    ]
)
```
