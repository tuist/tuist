:::caution Work in progress
[Tuist Cloud](https://github.com/tuist/cloud) is under development and therefore we don't recommend its usage yet.
If you feel adventurous and would like to be early adopter and feedback provider, 
you'll find up-to-date documentation here.

## Motivation

Before we dive into how to set up a project on **Tuist Cloud** we must understand what the tool is in the first place.
While developing Tuist,
we realized **workflows** and **integrations** that we could only enable through a server component.
A server allows storing state in a shared database,
has an [FQDN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fully_qualified_domain_name) that other services can reach through webhooks,
and can perform periodic tasks through jobs.
A server would open the door to new practical workflows that would significantly **improve the experience of scaling up Xcode projects and collaborating** when building apps.

Moreover,
we were looking for ways to make the project sustainable long-term.
Many open-source projects fail to achieve that, 
and they end up either abandoned or burning out the maintainers.
[GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/tuist) help cover some costs and contributions help keep the project moving.
Still, we believe the project would greatly benefit from working on it full-time, 
devising the direction,
implementing new features,
and providing continuous support.
What if **Tuist Cloud** is the solution?
That's what we are aiming to achieve, 
taking inspiration from tools like [Plausible](https://plausible.io/) and [Ghost](https://ghost.org/).

The project is an [open-source](https://github.com/tuist/cloud) Rails app licensed under MIT.
Teams can self-host it themselves.
However, 
we document the process to self-host the project and design it for easy hosting.
We **recommend** the usage of the Tuist-hosted solution.
It provides benefits like support, monitoring, and continuous updates,
and you support a project your project depends on.
You can also take the adventurous path of building your backend.
The [specification](/cloud/specification) documents the contract and designs it to be platform-agnostic.
