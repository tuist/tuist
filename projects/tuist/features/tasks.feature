Feature: Run tasks
  Scenario: The project is an application with tasks (app_with_tasks)
    Given that tuist is available
    And I have a working directory
    Then I copy the fixture app_with_tasks into the working directory
    Then tuist runs a task create-file
    Then content of a file named file.txt should be equal to File created with a task
    Then tuist runs a task create-file with attribute file-name as custom-file
    Then content of a file named custom-file.txt should be equal to File created with a task

  Scenario: The project is an application with plugins (app_with_plugins)
    Given that tuist is available
    And I have a working directory
    Then I copy the fixture app_with_plugins into the working directory
    Then tuist runs a task create-file
    Then content of a file named plugin-file.txt should be equal to File created with a plugin
    Then tuist-create-file is added to PATH
    Then tuist runs create-file
    Then content of a file named create-file.txt should be equal to run_from_task
