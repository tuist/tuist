Implement the following plan:

# Plan: Prune old binary cache entries

## Context

The binary cache at `~/.cache/tuist/Binaries/` can grow unbounded over time as users build different configurations. Currently, the only way to reclaim space is `tuist clean binaries`, which wipes everything. We want automatic pruning of stale entries, similar to how `SessionController` already prunes old session directories.

Since there's no explicit "last accessed" tracking, we'll use the filesystem's **modification date** of each hash directory. On macOS, we can also update this timestamp when a binary is fetched (via `touch`), so that actively-used binaries stay fresh. This is a lightweight approach that avoids adding new metadata files.

## Changes

### 1. Add `CacheLocalStorage.clean()` static method
**File:** `cli/TuistCacheEE/Sources/Storage/CacheLocalStorage.swift`

Add a static method following the same pattern as `SessionController.clean()`:

```swift
static func clean(
    fileSystem: FileSysteming,
    cacheDirectoriesProvider: CacheDirectoriesProviding,
    maxAge: TimeInterval = 7 * 24 * 60 * 60,  // 7 days
    maxEntries: Int = 200
) async throws
```

- Iterates over all hash directories in `~/.cache/tuist/Binaries/`
- Removes entries whose modification date is older than `maxAge` (default 7 days)
- If remaining entries exceed `maxEntries` (default 200), keeps only the newest ones
- Uses `FileManager.default.attributesOfItem` with `.modificationDate` (same approach as session cleanup)

### 2. Touch hash directory on fetch (update modification date)
**File:** `cli/TuistCacheEE/Sources/Storage/CacheLocalStorage.swift`

In the `fetch` method, after a successful lookup, update the modification date of the hash directory so that recently-accessed entries don't get pruned:

```swift
try? FileManager.default.setAttributes(
    [.modificationDate: Date()],
    ofItemAtPath: hashPath.pathString
)
```

This goes after the `lookupCompiledArtifact` call succeeds, using `try?` so it's best-effort and doesn't affect the fetch.

### 3. Schedule binary cache maintenance in `initDependencies`
**File:** `cli/Sources/tuist/Dependencies.swift`

Add a background task alongside the existing `sessionController.scheduleMaintenance()` call (line 80):

```swift
Task.detached(priority: .background) {
    try? await CacheLocalStorage.clean(
        fileSystem: FileSystem(),
        cacheDirectoriesProvider: CacheDirectoriesProvider()
    )
}
```

### 4. Add tests
**File:** `cli/Tests/TuistCacheEETests/Storage/CacheLocalStorageTests.swift`

Add tests mirroring `SessionControllerTests`:
- `test_clean_removesOldEntries` - creates entries with old modification dates, verifies they're removed
- `test_clean_limitsMaxEntries` - creates more than the max, verifies oldest are pruned
- `test_clean_keepsRecentEntries` - verifies entries within maxAge are kept
- `test_fetch_updatesModificationDate` - verifies that fetching a binary touches its directory

## Verification

1. Run the new tests:
   ```bash
   xcodebuild test -workspace Tuist.xcworkspace -scheme Tuist-Workspace -only-testing TuistCacheEETests/CacheLocalStorageTests
   ```
2. Run the session controller tests to make sure nothing is broken:
   ```bash
   xcodebuild test -workspace Tuist.xcworkspace -scheme Tuist-Workspace -only-testing TuistKitTests/SessionControllerTests
   ```
