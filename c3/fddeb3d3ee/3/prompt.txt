The logs and traces for cache nodes are now showing in Grafana, but I can't see the region of the nodes, How can we expose that information?

Doees that work with traces and logs?

Can you review and check if that's the most sensible way to approach this problem?

---

Why do you call it cloud_region?

---

Can you create a PR with this?
