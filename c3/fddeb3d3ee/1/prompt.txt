Implement the following plan:

# Fix: Static ObjC xcframeworks missing from search paths after binary caching

## Context

A user reported a bug (https://github.com/Alex-Ozun/TuistTestCaching): after `tuist cache App` and then `tuist generate --cache-profile all-possible`, the build fails with `Unable to find module dependency: 'GoogleMaps'`.

The project has: `App (target)` -> `FeatureA (dynamic framework)` -> `GoogleMaps.xcframework (static, ObjC)`.

After caching, FeatureA becomes a cached dynamic xcframework. The graph becomes:
`App (target)` -> `FeatureA.xcframework (dynamic)` -> `GoogleMaps.xcframework (static, ObjC)`

The `StaticXCFrameworkModuleMapGraphMapper` is designed to handle exactly this scenario (static ObjC xcframeworks behind dynamic xcframeworks) by adding `FRAMEWORK_SEARCH_PATHS`, `HEADER_SEARCH_PATHS`, and module map flags. However, **it bails out early** at line 32-33 when no `Package.swift` is found, which is the case for Tuist-native projects using `Project.swift`.

## Root Cause

In `cli/Sources/TuistKit/Mappers/Graph/StaticXCFrameworkModuleMapGraphMapper.swift` line 32-33:
```swift
guard let packageManifest = try await manifestFilesLocator.locatePackageManifest(at: graph.path)
else { return (graph, [], environment) }
```

The mapper needs a `derivedDirectory` to place generated module maps and umbrella headers. It computes this from `Package.swift`'s location. For non-SPM projects, `Package.swift` doesn't exist and the mapper does nothing, leaving the consuming target without the necessary search paths to find GoogleMaps's module.

## Fix

### 1. Modify `StaticXCFrameworkModuleMapGraphMapper.map()` to use a fallback derived directory

**File:** `cli/Sources/TuistKit/Mappers/Graph/StaticXCFrameworkModuleMapGraphMapper.swift`

Change lines 32-41 from returning early to computing a fallback path. When `Package.swift` is absent, use `{graph.path}/Tuist/.build/tuist-derived/` which mirrors the SPM convention and sits within the existing `Tuist/` directory that Tuist-native projects always have.

```swift
// Before:
guard let packageManifest = try await manifestFilesLocator.locatePackageManifest(at: graph.path)
else { return (graph, [], environment) }
let derivedDirectory = packageManifest.parentDirectory.appending(components: [...])

// After:
let derivedDirectory: AbsolutePath
if let packageManifest = try await manifestFilesLocator.locatePackageManifest(at: graph.path) {
    derivedDirectory = packageManifest.parentDirectory.appending(
        components: [
            Constants.SwiftPackageManager.packageBuildDirectoryName,
            Constants.DerivedDirectory.dependenciesDerivedDirectory,
        ]
    )
} else {
    derivedDirectory = graph.path.appending(
        components: [
            Constants.tuistDirectoryName,
            Constants.SwiftPackageManager.packageBuildDirectoryName,
            Constants.DerivedDirectory.dependenciesDerivedDirectory,
        ]
    )
}
```

This is a minimal, targeted change. Everything else in the mapper (module map generation, `FRAMEWORK_SEARCH_PATHS`, `HEADER_SEARCH_PATHS`, `$(SRCROOT)`-relative path calculation) works identically regardless of how `derivedDirectory` was computed.

### 2. Add tests for non-SPM projects

**File:** `cli/Tests/TuistKitTests/Mappers/Graph/StaticXCFrameworkModuleMapGraphMapperTests.swift`

Add two new test cases that mock `locatePackageManifest` to return `nil`, mirroring the existing tests at line 33 and 166:

- `test_map_when_static_xcframework_library_linked_via_dynamic_xcframework_without_package_manifest` - library-based (`.a`) xcframework without `Package.swift`, verifies module map side effects and build settings use `{graph.path}/Tuist/.build/tuist-derived/`
- `test_map_when_static_xcframework_framework_linked_via_dynamic_xcframework_without_package_manifest` - framework-based (`.framework`) xcframework without `Package.swift`, verifies `FRAMEWORK_SEARCH_PATHS` is set

These mirror the existing tests at lines 33-164 and 166-256 but with `manifestFilesLocator` returning `nil`.

## Verification

1. Run the new tests:
   ```
   xcodebuild test -workspace Tuist.xcworkspace -scheme Tuist-Workspace \
     -only-testing TuistKitTests/StaticXCFrameworkModuleMapGraphMapperTests
   ```

2. Run all existing mapper tests to verify no regressions:
   ```
   xcodebuild test -workspace Tuist.xcworkspace -scheme Tuist-Workspace \
     -only-testing TuistKitTests/StaticXCFrameworkModuleMapGraphMapperTests
   ```

3. End-to-end: clone the reproduction repo, run `tuist cache App`, then `tuist generate --cache-profile all-possible`, then `xcodebuild build` and verify it succeeds.
