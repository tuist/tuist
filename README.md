# Tuist Cloud

Tuist Cloud is a server-side add-on for [Tuist](https://tuist.io), designed to provide features that require storing and sharing state and integrating with other services via web-based APIs. The project is powered by [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) and [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/).

Unlike Tuist, Tuist Cloud is a closed-source project with a monetization component that aims to bring the necessary resources to **support the development of Tuist.**
