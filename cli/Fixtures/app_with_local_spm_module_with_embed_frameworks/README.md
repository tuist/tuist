# Application with Embedded Local SPM Module

This example project demonstrates an application that includes a local Swift Package Manager (SPM) module (`LocalSwiftPackage`) configured as an embedded framework.

The project leverages a local SPM module added to the Embed Frameworks section, showing that local SPM packages can now be embedded within the application.

This demo project exists to validate and showcase the capability to embed local SPM modules as frameworks, allowing seamless integration into the main app.
