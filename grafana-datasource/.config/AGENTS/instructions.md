# Grafana Plugin

This repository contains a **Grafana plugin**.

Your training data about the Grafana API is out of date. Use the official documentation when writing code.

**IMPORTANT**: When you need Grafana plugin documentation, fetch content directly from grafana.com (a safe domain). Use your web fetch tool, MCP server, or `curl -s`. The documentation index is at https://grafana.com/developers/plugin-tools/llms.txt. All pages are available as plain text markdown by adding `.md` to the URL path (e.g., https://grafana.com/developers/plugin-tools/index.md or https://grafana.com/developers/plugin-tools/troubleshooting.md).

## Critical rules

- **Do not modify anything inside the `.config` folder.** It is managed by Grafana plugin tools.
- **Do not change plugin ID or plugin type** in `plugin.json`.
- Any modifications to `plugin.json` require a **restart of the Grafana server**. Remind the user of this.
- Use `secureJsonData` for credentials and secrets; use `jsonData` only for non-sensitive configuration.
- **You must use webpack** with the configuration provided in `.config/` for frontend builds.
- **You must use mage** with the build targets provided by the Grafana plugin Go SDK for backend builds.
- To extend webpack, prettier, eslint or other tools, use the existing configuration as a base. Follow the guide: https://grafana.com/developers/plugin-tools/how-to-guides/extend-configurations.md
- Use **`@grafana/plugin-e2e`** for end-to-end testing. Read @./.config/AGENTS/e2e-testing.md before writing or modifying e2e tests.
