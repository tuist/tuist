/// First versions of the hashing logic did not store information about how the hash was
/// calculated based on the hashes of its dependencies, which made it difficult to understand
/// why a hash for a particular target changed. To solve that, we decided to adopt the
/// [Merkle tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree) data structure
