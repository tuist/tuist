/**
 When Swift Packages don't declare the platforms that they support, the Swift Package Manager defaults the value
 to 'support all the platforms'. This default behaviour is inherited into the Xcode projects that we generate off the packages
 and that causes compilation issues. Xcode must resolve this issue at build-time by cascading the platform requirements
 down from nodes in the graph that are closer to the root. This is a behaviour that we need to copy over to Tuist. In our case
 the logic is executed at generation time.
