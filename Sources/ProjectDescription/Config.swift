/// The configuration of your environment.
///
/// Tuist can be configured through a shared `Config.swift` manifest.
/// When Tuist is executed, it traverses up the directories to find a `Tuist` directory containing a `Config.swift` file.
/// Defining a configuration manifest is not required, but recommended to ensure a consistent behaviour across all the projects
/// that are part of the repository.
///
/// The example below shows a project that has a global `Config.swift` file that will be used when Tuist is run from any of the
/// subdirectories:
///
/// ```bash
/// /Workspace.swift
/// /Tuist/Config.swift # Configuration manifest
/// /Framework/Project.swift
/// /App/Project.swift
/// ```
///
/// That way, when executing Tuist in any of the subdirectories, it will use the shared configuration.
///
/// The snippet below shows an example configuration manifest:
///
/// ```swift
/// import ProjectDescription
///
/// let config = Config(
///     compatibleXcodeVersions: ["14.2"],
///     swiftVersion: "5.9.0"
/// )
/// ```

    /// Generation options.

    /// Set the versions of Xcode that the project is compatible with.
    public let compatibleXcodeVersions: CompatibleXcodeVersions

    /// List of `Plugin`s used to extend Tuist.
