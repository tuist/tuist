# 6-week cycles

At Tuist, we shape projects to be executable in 6-week cycles. We believe this timeframe strikes the perfect balance: long enough to deliver meaningful value to teams and developers using Tuist, yet short enough to maintain momentum, focus, and a sense of progress.

With our current company size, most projects will typically involve one full-time engineer, while designers work across multiple projects simultaneously, providing their expertise where needed.

> [!NOTE]
> Software estimation is inherently challenging. Even when we carefully scope work to fit within a 6-week cycle and aim to eliminate unknowns, unforeseen issues may still arise during development. When this happens, we commit to discussing challenges openly and collaboratively to find solutions that work for everyone.
