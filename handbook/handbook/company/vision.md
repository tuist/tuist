# Vision

**To create a platform where developers seamlessly craft exceptional apps for any platform, accelerating innovation and collaboration.**

Our vision is to create a platform where developers can seamlessly craft exceptional software for any platform, from iOS and Android to [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) and [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/). By removing barriers in the development process, we aim to empower teams to focus on what truly matters: delivering high-quality apps that meets the needs of their users. 

Our platform is designed to accelerate innovation, enabling developers to iterate faster and bring their ideas to life with unprecedented speed. At the heart of this vision is collaboration—building a community-driven ecosystem where developers come together to learn, share, and contribute toward a brighter future for software development.

## Think different™️

At the core of our company and software is a commitment to [openness](/engineering/open-source.html). We believe **the best ideas can come from anywhere**, and to harness this potential, we foster an environment where everyone can contribute. We embrace openness with curiosity and confidence, not fear.

Curiosity also drives our innovation. We are passionate about finding new ways to create value, focusing on making things better, faster, and more enjoyable rather than just balancing costs. **We love innovation and strive to continuously improve.** By sharing our innovations, we empower others to build their own businesses and tools. We welcome competition, believing that the best ideas stem from superior execution, which thrives in an inspiring environment – the very environment we endeavor to create.

Moreover, we are strong proponents of [standards](/engineering/standards). We aim to develop solutions that endure over time and give our users the freedom to move their data as they choose. We do not seek to lock anyone into using our platform; instead, we want them to stay because of the exceptional experience they have with Tuist.

Lastly, we meet developers where they are by integrating with their existing toolchains and ecosystems, rather than imposing a one-size-fits-all solution. We collaborate with existing ecosystems and open-source projects to enhance their tools and prepare for future scalability.
