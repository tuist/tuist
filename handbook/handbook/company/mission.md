# Mission

**To streamline app development through an integrated platform that helps developers build and share high-quality software at unmatched speed and scale.**

We believe building apps should be a joyful experience. When developers enjoy their work, they are more productive and create better, more impactful applications. Unfortunately, the current state of app development is far from enjoyable. Developers and teams often find themselves juggling a multitude of tools and data, spending more time building, debugging, and maintaining these tools than focusing on the apps themselves.

The web development ecosystem has tackled this challenge effectively with integrated platforms like [Vercel](https://vercel.com). These platforms take a holistic approach to the development process, providing a unified environment where all necessary tools and data converge seamlessly. They guide developers from the initial spark of an idea all the way to production, simplifying and accelerating the journey.

We believe app development should—and must—follow a similar path. Developers need a platform that takes them from idea to the app store, combining sensible defaults with the flexibility to adapt to unique needs. From continuous integration and release automation to analytics and testing, everything should be integrated into a cohesive experience.

The time has come to revolutionize app development by creating a platform that truly empowers developers to focus on what they do best—building exceptional apps.

> [!NOTE] FROM APPLE TO OTHER PLATFORMS
> We were born in the Apple ecosystem, but we believe the principles and tools we are developing can be applied to other ecosystems. We aspire to make building at scale delightful for everyone, regardless of the platform they are targeting.

## The app lifecycle

The complexity within the ecosystem today stems from the narrow focus of existing solutions. In many cases, proprietary tools either lack APIs or are not open-source, making integration challenging for developers. This not only incurs financial costs but also increases the long-term maintenance burden.

We believe that a simpler solution comes from taking a more holistic view of development—considering the entire lifecycle of an app, from the moment a developer envisions a new project to its release on the App Store.

Our goal is to understand this entire lifecycle and provide developers with the most effective solutions. By doing so, we ensure that the journey from idea to launch is as seamless as possible. Developers shouldn't have to spend time searching for the right tool or making decisions about their workflow—that's our job, driven by the insights we've gained from the needs of the community.

Think of Tuist as something you seamlessly integrate into your repository and then it just works effortlessly.
