# Tuist Digest Newsletter

Tuist Digest is a newsletter showcasing the most important work happening in Tuist and our vision for the future of app development at scale. Each edition highlights recent developments, upcoming features, and insights into how we're shaping the tools and practices teams need.

## Overview

The newsletter is sent at the end of every 6-week cycle via [Loops](https://app.loops.so/), where we have a template specifically created for this purpose.

The list of subscribers, templates, and campaigns are all managed using Loops. People can subscribe through the form at [tuist.dev/newsletter](https://tuist.dev/newsletter), and they can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link at the bottom of the newsletter.
