# Shared responsibility model

At Tuist, we rely on trusted infrastructure providers, such as [Fly.io](https://fly.io), [Tigris](https://tigrisdata.com) and [Supabase](https://supabase.com), to manage key aspects of our infrastructure security. These partnerships enable us to deliver reliable and secure services while focusing on application and data-level security.

This document outlines the shared responsibility model between Tuist and its infrastructure providers, detailing the security areas managed by each party.
