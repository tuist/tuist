# Physical security policy

- **Policy owner:** Pedro Piñera Buendía
- **Policy owner:** Effective Date: Oct 16, 2024

## Purpose

To prevent unauthorized physical access or damage to the organization's information and information processing facilities.

## Scope

All Tuist GmbH offices and locations. This Policy applies to all employees of Tuist GmbH, and to all external parties with
physical access to Tuist GmbH owned or leased facilities.

## Physical security perimeter

Physical offices and processing facilities shall meet all local building codes for construction materials for walls, windows,
doors, and access control mechanisms. Some interior zones may be identified as secure areas where physical access is
further restricted to a subset of Tuist GmbH personnel; such as private offices, wiring closets, print and server rooms, and
server racks.

## Physical entry controls

Secure areas shall be protected by appropriate entry controls to ensure that only authorized personnel are allowed access.
Where possible, Tuist GmbH access control systems shall be tied to a centralized system that provides granular access
control for individual personnel. Access events shall be appropriately logged and reviewed as needed according to risk.
Cameras and intrusion detection systems shall be used at facilities that store or process production or sensitive internal
company data.

## Securing offices, rooms & facilities

Physical security for offices, rooms and facilities shall be designed and applied to protect from theft, misuse, environmental
threats, unauthorized access, and other threats to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of classified data and
systems.

## Protecting against external & environmental threats

Physical protection against natural disasters, malicious attack or accidents shall be designed and applied. Secure areas
shall be monitored through the use of appropriate controls, such as intrusion detection systems, alarms, and/or video
surveillance systems, where feasible. Visitor and third-party access to secure areas shall be restricted to reduce the risk of
information loss and theft.

Production processing facilities shall be equipped with appropriate environmental and business continuity controls including
fire-suppression systems, climate control and monitoring systems, and emergency backup power systems. Physical
information system hardware and supporting infrastructure shall be regularly serviced and maintained in accordance with
the manufacturer's recommendations.

## Working in secure areas / visitor management

Visitors, delivery personnel, outside support technicians, and other external agents shall not be permitted access to secure
areas without escort and/or appropriate oversight. Third-parties in secure areas shall sign in and out on a visitor log and
shall be escorted or monitored by Tuist GmbH personnel. Tuist GmbH personnel observing unescorted visitors should
approach the visitor, confirm their status, and ensure they return to approved areas, or report the observation to the
responsible authority as needed. External party access to secure areas shall be confirmed with appropriate Tuist GmbH
personnel prior to being granted access. Tuist GmbH personnel providing access to external parties into secure areas are
responsible for ensuring that the third-party personnel adhere to all security requirements, and are accountable for all
actions taken by outsiders they provide with access. Visitors may be allowed to work unescorted provided that the Tuist
GmbH sponsoring party can ensure that they will not have unauthorized access to Tuist GmbH information systems,
networks, or data.

## Delivery & loading areas

Access points such as delivery and loading areas and other points where unauthorized persons could enter secure areas
shall be controlled and, if possible, isolated from information processing facilities to avoid unauthorized access.

## Supplier, vendor, and third-party security

Suppliers, vendors, and third-parties shall comply with Tuist GmbH physical security and environmental controls
requirements. Tuist GmbH shall assess the adequacy of third-party physical security controls as part of the vendor
management process, in accordance with the *Third-Party Management Policy.*

## Exceptions

Requests for an exception to this policy must be submitted to the IT Manager for approval.

## Violations & enforcement

Any known violations of this policy should be reported to the IT Manager. Violations of this policy can result in immediate
withdrawal or suspension of system and network privileges an
