# Incident response management

- **Policy owner:** Pedro Piñera Buendía
- **Policy owner:** Effective Date: Oct 16, 2024

## Contact information

In case of an incident, urgently report it to [contact@tuist.dev](mailto:contact@tuist.dev). The incident response team will take it from there.

## Vulnerability remediation SLAs

To ensure a swift and effective response to vulnerabilities, we have established the following SLAs for remediation based on severity:

- **Critical Vulnerabilities:** These vulnerabilities are addressed within **24 hours** of identification. Immediate action is taken to mitigate risks that could significantly impact systems, users, or data.
- **High Vulnerabilities:** These vulnerabilities are addressed within **72 hours** of identification. Prompt action is taken to reduce the likelihood of exploitation.

These timelines are integrated into our incident response process to ensure timely remediation and minimize potential risks.

## Plan

You can find the incident response plan in the [Incident Response Plan](/pdfs/security/human-and-incident-management/incident-response-plan-bsi.pdf) document.
