# Secure development policy

- **Policy owner:** Pedro Piñera Buendía
- **Policy owner:** Effective Date: Oct 16, 2024

## Purpose

To ensure that information security is designed and implemented within the development lifecycle for applications and information systems.

## Scope

All Tuist GmbH applications and information systems that are business critical and/or process, store, or transmit
Confidential data. This policy applies to all internal and external engineers and developers of Tuist GmbH software and
infrastructure.

## General requirements

This policy describes the rules for the acquisition and development of software and systems that shall be applied to
developments within the Tuist GmbH organization.

## System change control procedures

Changes to systems within the development lifecycle shall be controlled by the use of formal change control procedures.

Change control procedures and requirements are described in the Tuist GmbH Operations Security Policy.
Significant code changes must be reviewed and approved by Pedro Piñera Buendía before being merged into any
production branch in accordance with the process found here: https://handbook.tuist.io/engineering/standard-practices

Change control procedures shall ensure that development, testing and deployment of changes shall not be performed by a
single individual without approval and oversight.

## Software version control

All Tuist GmbH software is version controlled and synced between contributors (developers). Access to the central
repository is restricted based on an employee's role. All code is written, tested, and saved in a local repository before being
synced to the origin repository.

## Technical review of applications after operating platform changes

When operating platforms are changed, business critical applications shall be reviewed and tested to ensure that there is
no adverse impact on organizational operations or security.

## Restrictions on changes to software packages

Modifications to third-party business application packages shall be discouraged, limited to necessary changes and all
changes shall be strictly controlled.

## Secure system engineering principles

Principles for engineering secure systems shall be established, documented, maintained and applied to any information
system implementation efforts.

At a minimum, the following secure-by-design and privacy-by-design principles shall be applied:

Secure-by-design principles:

1. Minimize attack surface area
2. Establish secure defaults
3. The principle of Least privilege
4. The principle of defense in depth
5. Fail securely
6. Don't trust services
7. Separation of duties
8. Avoid security by obscurity
9. Keep security simple
10. Fix security issues correctly

Privacy-by-design principles:

1. Proactive not Reactive; Preventative not Remedial
2. Privacy as the Default Setting
3. Privacy Embedded into Design
4. Full Functionality - Positive-Sum, not Zero-Sum
5. End-to-End Security - Full Lifecycle Protection
6. Visibility and Transparency - Keep it Open
7. Respect for User Privacy - Keep it User-Centric

Engineering documentation and technical references can be found in the process here: https://handbook.tuist.io

Software developers are expected to adhere to Tuist GmbH's coding standards throughout the development cycle,
including standards for quality, commenting, and security.

## Secure development environment

Tuist GmbH shall establish and appropriately protect environments for system development and integration efforts that
cover the entire system development lifecycle. The following environments shall be logically or physically segregated:

- Production
- Test / Staging / Canary
- Development

## System security testing

Testing of security functionality shall be performed at defined periods during the development life cycle. No code shall be
deployed to Tuist GmbH production systems without documented, successful test results and evidence of security
remediation activities.

Comprehensive penetration testing shall be performed at least annually on applications and cloud resources according to the requirements outlined in the Penetration Testing Policy. As per our [Shared Responsibility Model](/security/shared-responsibility-model), network infrastructure penetration testing is the responsibility of our cloud provider Fly.io.

Application-level network traffic shall be monitored, controlled, managed, and periodically evaluated to identify vulnerabilities, anomalies, and capacity issues in accordance with the [Network Traffic Management Policy](/security/business-continuity-and-data-protection/network-traffic-management-policy).

## Application vulnerability management

Application code and dependencies should be scanned continuously using GitHub Dependabot, Snyk, Sobelow, and Trivy according to the requirements outlined in the [Vulnerability Scanning Policy](../secure-development-and-operations/vulnerability-scanning-policy.md). All Internet-exposed services and remote client applications shall undergo weekly vulnerability scanning. Sobelow shall be used for detecting vulnerabilities in Elixir application code with each commit, and Trivy shall be used for scanning repositories and Docker images before merging into main, both causing CI pipeline failures if security issues are detected. Patches to address application vulnerabilities shall be deployed according to the severity-based timelines defined in the Vulnerability Scanning Policy.

## System acceptance testing

Acceptance testing programs and related criteria shall be established for new information systems, upgrades and new
versions.

Prior to deploying code, a Release Checklist MUST be completed which includes a checklist of all Test Plans which show
the completion of all associated tests and remediation of identified issues.

## Protection of test data

Test data shall be selected carefully, protected and controlled. Confidential customer data shall be protected in accordance
with all contracts and commitments. Customer data shall not be used for testing purposes without the explicit permission of
the data owner and the CTO.

## Acquisition of third-party systems and software

The acquisition of third-party systems and software shall be done in accordance with the requirements of the Tuist GmbH
Third-Party Management Policy.

## Developer training

Software developers shall be provided with secure development training appropriate to their role at least annually. Training
content shall be determined by management but shall address the prevention of common web application attacks and
vulnerabilities. The following threats and vulnerabilities should be addressed as appropriate:

- Prevention of authorization bypass attacks
- Prevention of the use of insecure session IDs
- Prevention of Injection attacks
- Prevention of cross-site scripting attacks
- Prevention of cross-site request forgery attacks
- Prevention of the use of vulnerable libraries

## Exceptions

Requests for an exception to this Policy must be submitted to the IT Manager for approval.

## Violations & enforcement

Any known violations of this policy should be reported to the IT Manager. Violations of this policy can result in immediate
withdrawal or suspension of system and network privileges and/or disciplinary action in accordance with company
procedures up to and including termination of employment.
