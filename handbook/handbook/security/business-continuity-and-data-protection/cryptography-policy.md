# Cryptography Policy

- **Policy owner:** Pedro Piñera Buendía
- **Policy owner:** Effective Date: Oct 16, 2024

## Purpose

To ensure proper and effective use of cryptography to protect the confidentiality, authenticity and/or integrity of information.
This policy establishes requirements for the use and protection of cryptographic keys and cryptographic methods
throughout the entire encryption lifecycle.

## Scope

All information systems developed and/or controlled by Tuist GmbH which store or transmit confidential data.s

## General requirements

Tuist GmbH shall evaluate the risks inherent in processing and storing data, and shall implement cryptographic controls to
mitigate those risks where deemed appropriate. Where encryption is in use, strong cryptography with associated key
management processes and procedures shall be implemented and documented. All encryption shall be performed in
accordance with industry standards, including NIST SP 800-57.

Customer or confidential company data must utilize strong ciphers and configurations in accordance with vendor
recommendations and industry best practices including [NIST when stored or transferred over a public network.](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cryptographic-standards-and-guidelines)

## Key management

Access to keys and secrets shall be tightly controlled in accordance with the Access Control Policy.

The following table details Tuist GmbH's approved encryption algorithms:

| Domain | Key Type | Algorithm | Key Length | Max Expiration |
|--------|----------|-----------|------------|----------------|
| Web Certificate | RSA or ECC with SHA2+ signature | RSA or ECC with SHA2+ signature | 2048 bit or greater/RSA, 256bit or greater/ECC | Up to 1 year |
| Web Cipher (TLS) | Asymmetric Encryption | Ciphers of B or greater grade on SSL Labs Rating | Varies | N/A |
| Confidential Data at Rest | Symmetric Encryption | AES | 256 bit | 1 Year |
| Passwords | One-way Hash | Bcrypt, PBKDF2, or scrypt, Argon2 | 256 bit+10K Stretch. Include unique cryptographic salt+pepper | N/A |
| Endpoint Storage (SSD/HDD) | Symmetric Encryption | AES | 128 or 256 bit | N/A |

## Exceptions

Requests for an exception to this policy must be submitted to the IT Manager for approval.

A documented exception is required prior to moving, copying, or storing customer or company confidential data on any
media or removable device; all portable devices and removable media containing sensitive data must be encrypted using
approved standards and mechanisms.

## Violations & enforcement

Any known violations of this policy should be reported to the IT Manager. Violations of this policy can result in immediate
withdrawal or suspension of system and network privileges and/or disciplinary action in accordance with company
procedures up to and including termination of employment.
