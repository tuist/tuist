# Guidelines

Tuist’s target audience is developers, a group for whom many traditional marketing strategies may not resonate. We believe that effective marketing requires first understanding the developer mindset.

## Developers' mindset

Developers sit at the crossroads of creativity and logic. They’re driven by a desire to peek "under the hood" of systems, favoring transparency and openness over opaque solutions. Traditional sales and marketing tactics often fall flat with them—such approaches can feel intrusive or even off-putting.

Trust, for developers, is built through deep understanding. They can quickly discern whether content is thoughtful and well-crafted or merely attention-seeking fluff. They value extensibility, always anticipating edge cases where a tool might fall short. Vendor lock-in is a red flag they spot from a mile away, pushing them away from rigid ecosystems and toward open-source solutions. These collaborative, customizable, and forkable options align with their need for flexibility and control.

Collaboration is in their DNA. Developers thrive in open movements and gravitate toward community-driven efforts. They recognize that financial sustainability is necessary for projects to endure, but they bristle when profit feels like the primary motive.

Some developers harbor entrepreneurial ambitions, identifying as "indie" developers. For them, software is less a passion project and more a practical tool. They think in economic terms, treating technology as a means to an end and approaching it with a pragmatic, sometimes disposable mindset.

## Our community is our best marketing

A passionate, loyal community that feels part of a movement is a company’s most powerful marketing asset. Pair that with an ecosystem rooted in open source, and you create something unstoppable. Tuist began with open source principles, and we’re now doubling down—strengthening our commitment to foster a collaborative, innovative, and thriving ecosystem.

To make this happen, we invest in people. We support those who show up, offering guidance as they take their first steps using or contributing to Tuist. This approach is slow and deliberate, but it’s sustainable—unlike fast, capital-driven marketing that burns bright and fades fast. We want Tuist to be remembered for its values, mission, and community, not for saturating every conference, newsletter, blog, or social media feed.

Good things take time, and this kind of marketing is no exception. We see it as planting seeds—nurturing them patiently as they grow into something lasting.

Our focus doesn’t stop at attracting people to Tuist; we want them to stay and build with us. Right now, most stick around because they use or contribute to Tuist. But what if they could build on Tuist? We’re exploring creative ways to make that possible—through extensibility, like developing API clients or designing a platform that invites extensions. By empowering people to shape Tuist, we turn users into creators, deepening their connection to our mission.

## Slow, deep, and accessible content

Algorithms prioritize fresh, quick, and eye-catching content—a trend AI is amplifying. It’s easy to fall into the trap of spinning like a hamster on a wheel, churning out clickbait for platforms that hoard the value. Today, your meme might spread like wildfire; tomorrow, it’s all anyone recalls—but no one engages with your work.

Amid the overwhelming noise, people are weary. They cherish stumbling upon a signal—something substantial in an ocean of chaos. We aim to be that signal: a deliberate counterpoint to a world obsessed with speed.

Accessibility is the foundation. That means open web platforms. Let’s choose [the Community Forum](https://community.tuist.dev) over [Slack](https://slack.com) for rich, searchable discussions—spaces where deep ideas can breathe and be discovered. Our videos are published on our [PeerTube](https://joinpeertube.org/) instance at [videos.tuist.dev](https://videos.tuist.dev). We own the content. Let’s craft content on our blog and share it on open networks like [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/tuist.dev) or [Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@tuist), where we control our voice, not closed silos. LinkedIn’s an option, though its vibe feels off.

SEO isn’t complicated—here’s how we approach it:

- Write on topics people care about, but only if we can dive deep with meaning—no shallow fluff. Imagine advising a friend.
- Balance the mix: ⅓ SEO-focused articles, ⅓ tutorials, ⅓ freeform pieces.
- Focus on titles, keywords, and dwell time—Google tracks engagement, not nuance.
- Link to relevant resources and keep content fresh—Google rewards updates.

Our team should explore passions that intersect with what our audience expects from us. Writing about Tuist is fine, but it can’t be the sole focus—otherwise, we’re only visible to those already seeking us out. Broaden the lens to invite new readers who stay for the insight.

## On paid advertising

Paid marketing can feel forced to developers when it’s too broad or relentless. A mention at a conference, in a newsletter, or after a quiet stretch? That’s fine—it’s subtle. But plaster your name everywhere, and developers will sense you’re buying their attention, even encroaching on their time.

We’ll sponsor selectively—events, newsletters, blogs—focusing on emerging voices and initiatives just finding their footing. These are the people and projects we want to lift, boosting their confidence and fueling their growth. Finding them takes effort; they’re often quiet, shying from the spotlight. But they’re our audience. The strongest voices lie dormant, waiting for a spark—we aim to be that spark.

Our sponsorships must spotlight the problem, tie it to our solution, and share our vision for the space—Tuist’s role included. Values matter too. We’re not just another developer tool; we’re one that champions open source as a win for all. Money is our means to amplify this, not our endgame. Every sponsorship should echo that ethos.

## Show your true colors

We’ve built a team brimming with passion for this space—let that shine in everything you publish. Passion is contagious; when you reveal what drives you, it sparks curiosity about your work and Tuist. It’s human nature to connect with authenticity—traditional marketing feels forced unless it’s woven with storytelling.

Communicate with respect and joy. Center your focus on the problem and the solution, steering clear of toxic traps like comparisons or schadenfreude over other tools. Highlight Tuist’s strengths, and if asked to compare, offer honest pros and cons if you’re informed—or simply admit you haven’t explored the alternatives.

Share your take on the problem space: how you see it evolving and where Tuist fits in. Offer bite-sized, creative ideas for tackling challenges in fresh ways. People crave originality, and at Tuist, we’re full of it—let’s not keep it to ourselves.
