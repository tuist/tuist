# Case studies

Case studies are a useful tool to **celebrate the success of Tuist users and showcase the impact of Tuist on their projects.** They provide a real-world perspective on how Tuist has helped teams overcome challenges and achieve their goals.
It helps future customers understand the value of Tuist through the lenses of existing organizations, giving Tuist credibility and trustworthiness.

Therefore, we should suggest organizations to share their stories with us, so we can create case studies that can be shared on our website, blog, and social media channels. Note that some might not feel comfortable sharing their stories publicly, so we should respect their privacy and only publish case studies with their explicit consent.

Once an organization has agreed to share their story, you can use the following template to create a case study:

- **Name:** The name of the organization.
- **URL:** A link to the organization's website.
- **Solutions:** The features of Tuist that the organization used to solve their challenges.
- **The problem/challenge:** One pragraph describing the challenges the organization faced.
- **Why Tuist?:** One paragraph explaining why the organization chose Tuist. You can use bullet points to list the various reasons.
- **The results:** A list of advantages and improvements that the organization experienced after adopting Tuist. Each one should be a title followed by a paragraph describing the impact.
