# Needs pool

Tuist must solve real needs that people have.
Sometimes,
those ideas come from us [eating our own food](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food).
Other times,
they come from conversations with developers and organizations.
When we've identified that a need is real and that it's worth solving because it aligns with our vision and is very common among teams, we should capture it here.

The following sections capture the needs that we've identified so far organized by product area and priority.

> [!TIP] FOCUS ON THE PROBLEM, NOT THE SOLUTION
> Ensure you put the focus on the need detailing it as much as possible and including the impact it has on the person or organization. You are free to include potential solutions for anyone to consider, but the focus should be on the problem.

> [!NOTE] GITHUB ISSUES
> Issues are reserved for bugs and small features that are ready to be implemented. For broader and more strategic ideas, we use this document.

## Projects

### High priority

<br/>

#### Teams can't express a group of targets through the CLI interface

Commands like `tuist generate` require passing a list of arguments representing targets the command targets. This is cumbersome, and leads to teams building their own scripts on top of Tuist. We should extend the targets API to pass unstructured metadata that they can use from commands, for example `tuist generate domain:foo`. In the future, we can introduce some structure for example team IDs, which an be used server-side to correlate projects data with teams. The same grouping mechanism can be used in commands like `tuist graph` to filter the output.

### Medium priority

<br/>

##### Teams can't codify dependency rules to be enforced

It's common that teams have a set of rules around what dependencies are allowed in their projects. For example, a feature module can't depend on another feature module implementation. Teams had to build their own tools that parse the output of `tuist graph` and run validations on top of it. It'd be great if Tuist could provide a way to codify those rules and enforce them, for example through a `tuist lint links` command.


## Unlockers

Unlockers is foundational investment that will enable solving other needs in the future.

### Medium priority

<br/>

#### Swift-based automation DSL

People are eager to have a Swift-based Fastlane. However, none of the attempts reached a level of adoption that would make them a standard. We believe it's because many of those attempts have disregarded the importance of extensibility in enabling a community of plugin developers. We should invest in a Swift-based automation DSL that is extensible and allows developers to build plugins that can be shared with the community.
