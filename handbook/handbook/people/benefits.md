# Benefits

At many technology companies, perks are offered on top of salaries‚Äîfree lunches, gym memberships, or wellness stipends. While these benefits can be appealing, they often create an emotional dependency between employees and the company. This isn‚Äôt something we encourage at Tuist. Instead, we believe in **paying people fairly** and **giving them the freedom** to decide how to spend their compensation in ways that best support their needs and lifestyle.

## Flexible approach to compensation

We ensure that everyone at Tuist receives a **competitive salary** based on their experience level and location.

Rather than predefining perks for you, we give you the autonomy to decide. Want to use it for a gym membership? That‚Äôs great! Would you rather invest in learning a new language? Perfect! This approach ensures that your compensation is truly yours and that you‚Äôre not tied to perks chosen by the company.

## Investing in the tools & support you need

### üíª The right equipment from day one

We want you to work with the best tools available. Every team member receives a **high-end MacBook** to ensure a smooth and efficient workflow.

### üåç An open & transparent culture

Tuist is designed to be an **open company**. That means you‚Äôll have insight into how decisions are made and the opportunity to participate in shaping our direction. We believe that transparency fosters trust and collaboration, and we actively encourage contributions from everyone on the team.

### üè° Remote-first, with flexibility

You have complete control over where you work. Whether you prefer working from home, in a co-working space, or while traveling, the choice is yours. If you're based in Berlin, we provide a desk in a shared workspace, giving you the option to collaborate in person with teammates when needed.

We currently hire only in Germany and can assist with relocation and visa processes if required. In the future, we may expand to hiring globally through Employer of Record (EoR) platforms if we find exceptional candidates.

### ‚è≥ Work on your schedule

We understand that productivity looks different for everyone. At Tuist, you have **full flexibility** to structure your work hours in a way that allows you to do your best work. We rely on **asynchronous communication** to keep projects moving forward without requiring everyone to be online at the same time.

## Growing & learning together

We believe in **continuous learning and professional development.** To support that, we provide:

### üìö A ‚Ç¨1,000 annual learning budget

This can be used for courses, books, certifications, or attending industry events. If you‚Äôre traveling for a conference, we‚Äôll cover transport, tickets, and accommodation‚Äîas long as it stays within the budget. If you are speaking or giving a workshop at a conference, we‚Äôd cover the costs that are not covered by the organizers.

### üõ†Ô∏è A ‚Ç¨500 one-time hardware budget
To help you set up your ideal work environment, we provide a one-time budget that you can use for anything from a comfortable office chair to additional tech accessories.

### üë• An annual team retreat
While we‚Äôre a remote-first company, we recognize the value of in-person connections. That‚Äôs why we organize an annual retreat where the entire team gets together for a week. Each year, we choose a different location, giving everyone a chance to step away from daily work, collaborate, and build stronger relationships‚Äîit‚Äôs one of the highlights of the year!

In addition to the retreat, we also come together for hack events. These focused gatherings allow us to brainstorm, prototype, and work intensively on innovative ideas while enjoying the energy of in-person teamwork. Whether it's tackling big challenges or experimenting with new concepts, these events bring a fresh perspective and strengthen our collaboration.

At Tuist, our philosophy is simple: **We trust you to make the best decisions for yourself.** Rather than imposing perks, rigid schedules, or unnecessary rules, we focus on **empowering you with the flexibility, tools, and support needed to do your best work.** We believe that when people feel trusted, valued, and supported, great things happen.
