# Contributing

Tuist's website is a static website generated with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) and continuously deployed using [Netlify](https://netlify.com).
With Gatsby, we we can describe the UI using React's mental models and have access to an extensive pool of resources and tools, which results in a great experience while building the website.
Moreover, we can easily introduce dynamism into static pages with plugins like [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/).

### Installing dependencies

You can use programs like [chruby](https://github.com/postmodern/chruby) and [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to ensure you are using the expected versions.
