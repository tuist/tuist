## March 26th 2020 - Acceptance tests and multiple versions of Xcode

I attempted to add set up GitHub actions to run the tests on multiple versions of Xcode and I realized that the acceptance tests that depend on precompiled frameworks an libraries can only run with a version of Xcode. 
I made the tradeoff of **always running the acceptance tests with the latest version of Xcode** to avoid increasing the cost of maintaining those tests.
This is a decision that we should revisit if we notice that we ship changes that break the backwards compatibility without us realizing it.
