# Release

The process for releasing new versions of Tuist is described in the [`RELEASE.md` file](https://github.com/tuist/tuist/blob/master/RELEASE.md),
located in the root directory of the project.
Only maintainers from the [Core team](/docs/contribution/core-team/) have rights,
and are allowed to champion releases.

## Cadence

Tuist is released following a weekly cadence. Note that we **might skip** the release train if there aren't enough changes to justify a release,
or if there aren't people available to champion it.
