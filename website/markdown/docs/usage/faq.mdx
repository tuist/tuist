## What happens when I switch a branch?

When you switch a branch where files have been added or removed, the Xcode project should be re-generated. Unfortunately, it is a manual action. It is recommended to set up a git [post-checkout](https://www.git-scm.com/docs/githooks#_post_checkout) hook. To do so, create a `post-checkout` script in `.git/hooks` folder in your repository:

```bash
#!/bin/sh

tuist generate
```

Remember to set a `post-checkout` script as executable
