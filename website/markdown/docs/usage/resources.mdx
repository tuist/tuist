# Accessing resources

Depending on the target product (e.g. app, framework), resources are accesed differently.
For example, if we are trying to get an image that is part of an app target, we get the image from the `Bundle.main`.
Conversely, if the image is part of a framework, we access it from the `Bundle` that represents the framework, `Bundle(for: FrameworkClass.self).resourceURL`.
Having an **inconsistent interface** for accessing resources complicates moving code a resources around.

Moreover,
as you might know,
libraries can't contain resources - only frameworks can.
On iOS,
this often leads projects to use dynamic frameworks instead of static libraries,
and in some cases,
add custom build phases that copy resources from dependencies into the final product (app).
Resorting to this setup is not ideal because it introduces side effects, complicates the maintenance of the project, and makes the setup hard to reason about.

## A consistent way for accessing resources

Tuist solves this by generating a `Bundle` extension for accessing the right bundle depending on the type of target.
For example, given a target framework `MyFeature`, you'll be able to get the right bundle with:

```swift
let bundle = Bundle.module
```

Furthermore, we support defining resources in products that don't support it (e.g. libraries). For those, we generate an associated bundle target (e.g. `MyFeatureResources.bundle`) that contains all the resources. The bundle ends up being copied into the final product bundle that contains compiled target.

### Objective-C

Tuist also synthesizes accessors for Objective-C.
In this case, the Bundle needs to be accessed using the target name to avoid name conflicts:

```objectivec
NSBundle *bundle = [MyFeatureResources bundle];
```
