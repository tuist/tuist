# Using Plugins

## Plugins

Plugins are meant to be separate and isolated directories, each containing code used to extend existing Tuist functionality. 
You may use plugins that exist at a path local to your machine or at a git source URL to enable sharing and version control across multiple projects.

## Adding plugins

In order to tell Tuist you'd like to use plugins in your project, you can start by defining the plugins in the [`Config.swift`](/docs/usage/config/) manifest.

```swift
import ProjectDescription

let config = Config(
    plugins: [
        .local(path: "/Plugins/MyPlugin"),
        .git(url: "https://url/to/plugin.git", tag: "1.0.0"),
        .git(url: "https://url/to/plugin.git", sha: "e34c5ba")
    ]
)
```

By defining plugins in the [`Config.swift`](/docs/usage/config/) manifest Tuist is able to collect, cache and use your plugins to add or extend functionality.

### Local plugin

Local plugins are stored relative to the machine generating the project. You can tell Tuist to find them at a given [`Path`](/docs/usage/project-description/). 

```swift
PluginLocation.local(path: "/Plugins/MyPlugin")
PluginLocation.local(path: .relativeToCurrentFile("MyOtherPlugin/"))
PluginLocation.local(path: .relativeToManifest("../DevelopmentPlugin"))
```

### Remote plugin

Remote plugins are stored on a remote server and can be downloaded by Tuist and shared across multiple projects.

#### git

A common place to store plugins is in a git repository which is uploaded to a remote server. You can specify where to download the plugin as well as what version of the plugin to take.
This allows you to version your plugins and share them with others.

You can choose to collect a plugin at a specific git tag:

```swift
PluginLocation.git(url: "https://url/to/plugin.git", tag: "1.0.0"),
```

You may also collect a plugin at a specific git sha:

```swift
PluginLocation.git(url: "https://url/to/plugin.git", sha: "e34c5ba")
```

The [`Plugin.swift`](/docs/plugins/creating-plugins/) manifest in a git repository should be located at the root of the repository.

## Example

Let's say we have a plugin called `MyTuistPlugin`. This plugin is designed to add functionality to `ProjectDescription`, in this example the plugin will add a new method to `Project` which allow us to define an application.
This plugin is stored in git on some remote server, and we'd like to use version `1.0.0` of the plugin.

We must first configure Tuist to use our plugin, we can do that by adding the plugin to the [`Config.swift`](/docs/usage/config/) manifest.

```swift
import ProjectDescription

let config = Config(
    plugins: [
        .git(url: "https://url/to/MyTuistPlugin", tag: "1.0.0")
    ]
)
```

### Project description helpers

You can import a project description helper plugin with the name defined in the [`Plugin.swift`](/docs/plugins/creating-plugins/) manifest, which can then be used in a project manfiest:

```swift
import ProjectDescription
import MyTuistPlugin

let project = Project.app(name: "MyCoolApp", platform: .iOS)
```
