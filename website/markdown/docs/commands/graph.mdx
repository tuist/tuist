# Project graph

When projects grow, it becomes hard to visualize the dependencies between all the targets that are part of the project. Fortunately, Tuist provides a command, `tuist graph`, that loads your project dependencies graph and exports it in a human-readable format.

## Command

Being in a directory that contains a workspace or project manifest, run the following command:

```bash
tuist graph
```

### Besides running the plain graph command, an enduser can opt to exclude either tests and/or third party dependencies

The additional arguments are:
- `skipTestTargets`
- `skipExternalDependencies`
- `format`: `dot` (default), `png`

The command will output the dependency graph in `dot` (see [DOT](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOT_(graph_description_language)>)) or `png` format.
