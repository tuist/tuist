# Project graph

When projects grow, it becomes hard to visualize the dependencies between all the targets that are part of the project. Fortunately, Tuist provides a command, `tuist graph`, that loads your project dependencies graph and exports it.
The command will output the dependency graph in `dot` (see [DOT](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOT_(graph_description_language)>)) or `png` format.
For producing a `png` image that represent the graph, you can use some well known graphviz [layout algorithms](https://graphviz.org/documentation/).

## Command

Run the following command from a directory that contains a workspace or project manifest:

```bash
tuist graph --format=png
```

If you prefer to have the dot representation of the graph and render it separately, you can run:

```bash
tuist graph --format=dot
```

### All options

The additional arguments are:
- `skipTestTargets`
- `skipExternalDependencies`
- `format`: `dot` (default), `png`
- `layout-algorithm`: `dot`, `neato`, `twopi`, `circo`, `fdp`, `sfddp`, `patchwork`. The deafault is `dot`, `fdp` is particularly good for big graphs.
- `path` the path were the png image of the graph will be saved. When not specified, it defaults to the current directory
