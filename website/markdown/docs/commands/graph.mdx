# Project graph

When projects grow, it becomes hard to visualize the dependencies between all the targets that are part of the project. Fortunately, Tuist provides a command, `tuist graph`, that loads your project dependencies graph and exports it.
The command will output the dependency graph in `dot` (see [DOT](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOT_(graph_description_language)>)) or `png` format.
For producing a `png` image that represent the graph, you can use some well known graphviz [layout algorithms](https://graphviz.org/documentation/).

## Command

Run the following command from a directory that contains a workspace or project manifest:

```bash
tuist graph --format png
```

If you prefer to have the dot representation of the graph and render it separately, you can run:

```bash
tuist graph --format dot
```
