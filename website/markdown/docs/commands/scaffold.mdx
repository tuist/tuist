# Scaffold files

In projects with an established architecture, developers might want to bootstrap new components or features that are consistent with the project.
With `tuist scaffold` you generate files, you can generate files from a template. You can define your own templates or use the ones that are vendored with Tuist. These are some **scenarios** where scaffolding might be useful:

- Create a new feature that follows a given architecture: `tuist scaffold viper --name MyFeature`.
- Create new projects: `tuist scaffold feature-project --name Home`

Tuist is not opinionated about the content of your templates, and what you use them for. They are only required to be in a specific directory, with a `Template.swift` manifest file that describes it.

## Defining a template

To define templates, you can run `tuist edit` and then create a directory under `Tuist/Templates` that represents your template. Templates need a manifest file, `Template.swift` that describes the template:

```swift
import ProjectDescription

let nameAttribute: Template.Attribute = .required("name")

let template = Template(
    description: "Custom template",
    attributes: [
        nameAttribute,
        .optional("platform", default: "ios"),
    ],
    files: [
        .string(path: "Project.swift",
                contents: "My template contents of name \(nameAttribute)"),
        .file(path: "generated/Up.swift",
              templatePath: "generate.stencil"),
    ],
)
```

## Scaffold command

After defining the template, we can use it from the `scaffold` command:

```bash
tuist scaffold name_of_template --name Name --platform macos
```

Since platform is an optional argument, we can also call the command without the `--platform macos` argument.

If `.string` and `.files` don't provide enough flexibility, you can leverage the [Stencil](https://github.com/stencilproject/Stencil) templating language via the `.file` case.

Templates can import [project description helpers](/docs/usage/helpers/). Just add `import ProjectDescriptionHelpers` at the top, and extract reusable logic into the helpers.
