# Migrate Xcode projects

To help developers with the process of [adopting Tuist](/docs/usage/adoption-guidelines/),
Tuist provides a set of commands under `tuist migration`.

## Extract build settings into xcode build configuration files

It's recommended to make `.xcconfig` files the source of truth for build settings.
For that, Tuist provides a `tuist migration settings-to-xcconfig` command that extracts the build settings from targets and projects.

```bash
# Extract target build settings
tuist migration settings-to-xcconfig -p Project.xcodeproj -t MyApp -x MyApp.xcconfig

# Extract project build settings
tuist migration settings-to-xcconfig -p Project.xcodeproj -x MyAppProject.xcconfig
```

#### Arguments

<ArgumentsTable
  args={[
    {
      long: '`--xcodeproj-path`',
      short: '`-p`',
      description:
        'Path to the Xcode project whose build settings will be extracted.',
      required: true,
    },
    {
      long: '`--xcconfig-path`',
      short: '`-x`',
      description:
        'Path to the .xcconfig file into which the build settings will be extracted.',
      required: true,
    },
    {
      long: '`--target`',
      short: '`-t`',
      description:
        'The name of the target whose build settings will be extracted. When not passed, it extracts the build settings of the project.',
      required: false,
    },
  ]}
/>

## Ensure project and target build settings are empty

After making `.xcconfig` files the source of truth for build settings,
it's important to ensure that build settings are no longer set to the project.
To help with that, Tuist includes a command that fails if the build settings of a project or a target are not empty:

```bash
tuist migration check-empty-settings -p Project.xcodeproj -t MyApp
```

#### Arguments

<ArgumentsTable
  args={[
    {
      long: '`--xcodeproj-path`',
      short: '`-p`',
      description:
        'Path to the Xcode project whose build settings will be checked.',
      required: true,
    },
    {
      long: '`--target`',
      short: '`-t`',
      description:
        'The name of the target whose build settings will be checked. When not passed, it checks the build settings of the project.',
      required: false,
    },
  ]}
/>

## List targets sorted by dependencies

Migration of big Xcode projects to Tuist can happen iteratively, one target at a time. It makes sense to start from the target with the lowest number of dependencies.
To help with that, Tuist includes a command that lists the targets of a project sorted by number dependencies ascending. 

```bash
tuist migration list-targets -p Project.xcodeproj
```

#### Arguments

<ArgumentsTable
  args={[
    {
      long: '`--xcodeproj-path`',
      short: '`-p`',
      description:
        'Path to the Xcode project whose build settings will be checked.',
      required: true,
    }
  ]}
/>
