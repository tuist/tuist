# Generate projects

Project generation is one of Tuist's core features.
It loads your project's dependency graph by reading the manifest files _(e.g. Project.swift, Workspace.swift)_, and translates it into
Xcode projects and workspaces.
You can think of manifest files as an simple and approachable abstraction of Xcode projects' intricacies,
and Xcode projects and workspaces as a implementation detail to edit your project's code.

## Command

To generate the project in the current directory, youn can simply run:

```
tuist generate
```

The command accepts the `--path` argument, which can be used to generate the project in a different directory.

There might be situations when you are only interested in generating the project in a given directory, and not the projects it depends on. For that, you can pass the argument `--project-only`.

### Arguments

<ArgumentsTable
  args={[
    {
      long: '`--path`',
      short: '`-p`',
      description:
        'The path to the directory that contains the definition of the project.',
      default: 'Current directory',
    },
    {
      long: '`--project-only`',
      short: '`-P`',
      description:
        'Only generate the local project (without generating its dependencies).',
      default: '`false`',
    },
    {
      long: '`--open`',
      short: '`-o`',
      description: 'Open the project after generating it.',
      default: '`false`',
    },
  ]}
/>
