# About Stats

Tuist sends some **anonymous** analytics events to track the usage of the tool.
Having statistics about the usage helps contributors to take informed decision and better prioritize future work.
For example, if a command is only used by 1% of the users, it might not get prioritized for enhancements in the future.

The events that are tracked are listed on this the documentation. The implementation is open source, mainly in the [TuistAnalytics](https://github.com/tuist/tuist/tree/main/Sources/TuistAnalytics) target.
If you are thinking about adding another event, please remember that we would like to keep tracking minimal and unobtrusive.

## Can I see the data?

The data is collected on a server implemented in the [Tuist repository](https://github.com/tuist/stats) and published on the
[Tuist Stats website](https://stats.tuist.io/).

## Can I opt out?

Users can opt out from Tuist stats by setting this environment variable to `TRUE`:

```
TUIST_STATS_OPT_OUT
