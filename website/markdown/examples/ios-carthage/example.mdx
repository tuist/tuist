title: "iOS app with Carthage dependencies"
---

import File from "../components/file"

This example contains an iOS app that uses Carthage to pull some third-party dependencies that the app is linked against.

<File language="swift" fileName="Project.swift" code="ios-carthage-project"/>

We can include a `Setup.swift` file to indicate that Carthage dependencies should be pulled when running the `tuist up` command:

<File language="swift" fileName="Setup.swift" code="ios-carthage-setup"/>
