Tuist 0.13.0 has been released! üéâ

We‚Äôre taking turns releasing and writing about what‚Äôs new in the world of Tuist. I‚Äôm Kas and will be your host through this post on the latest developments.

## Contributors

In this release Tuist gained a new contributor! [@BalestraPatrick](https://github.com/BalestraPatrick) fixed a warning in newly generated projects [#291](https://github.com/tuist/tuist/pull/291). Additionally, [@pepibumur](https://github.com/pepibumur) and [@ollieatkinson](https://github.com/ollieatkinson) have been hard at work blitzing through numerous bug fixes and improvements üëè.

Contributions also come in the form of valuable feedback, a huge shout out to [@enhorn](https://github.com/enhorn) for actively reporting [issues and suggestions](https://github.com/tuist/tuist/issues?utf8=‚úì&q=is%3Aissue+author%3Aenhorn+) to enhance Tuist.

We‚Äôre really grateful for all the community contributions to improving Tuist!

## What‚Äôs new?

The latest update can be obtained via running:

```sh
tuist update
```

The full changelog can be viewed on the [0.13.0 release page](https://github.com/tuist/tuist/releases/tag/0.13.0). Here are some highlights.

## Homebrew tap support

The `Setup.swift` manifest now supports brew tap!

```swift
import ProjectDescription

let setup = Setup([
	.homebrewTap(repositories: ["peripheryapp/periphery"])
])
```

Calling `tuist up` will ensure the tap is added to Homebrew.

## Workspace Improvements

By default, calling `tuist generate` will create an Xcode workspace containing the current project and all its dependencies.

New in 0.13.0, the generated Xcode workspace structure reflects the file system!

Additionally, the `Workspace.swift` manifest has been enhanced to allow the inclusion of files and folder references that don‚Äôt necessarily belong to a particular project - your Documentation files can now be included!

```swift
import ProjectDescription

let workspace = Workspace(name: "Workspace",
                          projects: [
                              "App",
                              "Frameworks/**",
                            ],
                            additionalFiles: [
                                "Documentation/**",
                                .folderReference(path: "Website")
                            ])
```

## Host application for unit & ui tests

Tuist now automatically sets the host & target application for test targets that declare they depend on applications.

For example take the following `Project.swift` manifest:

```swift
import ProjectDescription

let project = Project(name: "App",
                      targets: [
                          Target(name: "App",
                                 platform: .iOS,
                                 product: .app,
                                 bundleId: "io.tuist.App",
                                 infoPlist: "Info.plist",
                                 sources: "Sources/**"),
                          Target(name: "AppTests",
                                 platform: .iOS,
                                 product: .unitTests,
                                 bundleId: "io.tuist.AppTests",
                                 infoPlist: "Tests.plist",
                                 sources: "Tests/**",
                                 dependencies: [
                                     .target(name: "App"),
                                 ]),
                          Target(name: "AppUITests",
                                 platform: .iOS,
                                 product: .uiTests,
                                 bundleId: "io.tuist.AppUITests",
                                 infoPlist: "Tests.plist",
                                 sources: "UITests/**",
                                 dependencies: [
                                    .target(name: "App"),
                                ])
])
```

The generated project will have the host and target application set to **App** for the unit and ui test targets.

## What‚Äôs next?

- [#265](https://github.com/tuist/tuist/issues/265) Storyboard enhancements - adding the ability to automatically generate the appropriate storyboard files via `tuist init` as well as explicitly specifying them within the `Project.swift` manifest to include in the generated Xcode project.

- [#160](https://github.com/tuist/tuist/issues/160) Multiple configurations - a few different options are being explored, such as environments or possibly even `include`s to help reduce repeated definitions.

- [#316](https://github.com/tuist/tuist/issues/316) Xcode 10.2 & Swift 5 support.

If you have any ideas or feedback on these items or any others, please feel free to reach out on [GitHub](https://github.com/tuist/tuist) or [Slack](http://slack.tuist.io)!

Happy Xcoding üõ†!
