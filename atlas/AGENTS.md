This is a web application written using the Phoenix web framework.

## Documentation

Do not add README entries for internal operational details such as env var names, secret manager or External Secrets wiring, cron schedules, or implementation-specific deployment notes unless the user explicitly asks for public project documentation. Prefer code comments, infrastructure runbooks, PR descriptions, or this file for that context.

## Upstream MCP discovery

- `Atlas.MCP.Proxy` discovers tools using the current caller's upstream OAuth session and MCP tool groups. Client → Atlas authorization is separate from Atlas → upstream authorization; reconnect the specific upstream at `/admin/mcps` only when diagnostics support doing so.
- `get_mcp_connection_status` performs fresh discovery for one permitted upstream. Discovery failures also expose `<server>__atlas_connection_status` instead of silently removing every trace of that upstream. Both return sanitized failure categories/stages or currently permitted tool schemas; neither calls an upstream business tool.
- Keep discovery diagnostics free of response bodies, tokens, and raw transport errors. Do not reuse schemas across users or after an authorization change. There is no schema/failure cache; after recovery, clients must request `tools/list` again to refresh their catalog. The diagnostic remains callable from an older catalog.
- The `tuist` upstream is proxied read-only and receives Atlas' ServiceAccount token in `x-tuist-atlas-identity`. The Tuist server lets operators read any customer account only when that header verifies, because every proxied call is recorded here as `mcp.tool_called`. Only send the header to upstreams configured with `atlas_identity_header`, and never for the Slack agent, which runs as one fixed operator.
- Streamable HTTP session IDs are optional. Forward them when provided, but do not reject a successful initialization solely because the header is absent.
- Transient OAuth refresh failures (transport errors, HTTP 429/5xx) preserve the refresh credential for a later attempt without returning an expired access token. Definitive refresh failures still require reauthorization.
- The monorepo release workflow is `.github/workflows/atlas-release.yml`, chart `infra/helm/atlas`, namespace `atlas-production` on the separate Atlas workload cluster. The Tuist production context does not target this deployment.

## CSS & Styling

- **Always** use `data-part` attributes as CSS selectors instead of classes. This is the project's convention for styling components, matching the Noora design system pattern. For example:

  ```html
  <div data-part="header">
    <span data-part="title">Title</span>
  </div>
  ```

  ```css
  & > [data-part="header"] {
    & > [data-part="title"] {
      font: var(--noora-font-weight-medium) var(--noora-font-heading-medium);
    }
  }
  ```

## Project guidelines

- When opening GitHub pull requests, use a semantic commit style title, for example `feat(accounts): reconcile Stripe invoices`.
- Use `mix precommit` alias when you are done with all changes and fix any pending issues
- Use the already included and available `:req` (`Req`) library for HTTP requests, **avoid** `:httpoison`, `:tesla`, and `:httpc`. Req is included by default and is the preferred HTTP client for Phoenix apps
- Use the already included `:flop` (`Flop`) dependency for pagination in query APIs instead of hand-rolled limit, offset, count, or cursor metadata unless there is a specific reason Flop does not fit.
- When adding a new data structure or user-facing feature, consider whether `priv/repo/seeds.exs` should include realistic, idempotent seed data so the feature is useful in local development and review. Skip it when seed data would be noisy or misleading.
- Audit every internal operation that would be relevant when reconstructing what happened later, including who initiated it, which interface it came through (`dashboard`, `mcp`, `slack`, `api`, `worker`, or `system`), the action name, target, and useful metadata. When the affected resource is accessible from the dashboard, include its dashboard path in the audit event metadata. Use `Atlas.Audit.record/3` from domain boundaries instead of logging only in UI, MCP, or Slack adapters.
- When adding a new capability (a new domain action, a new read query worth surfacing externally), make sure the MCP server reflects it too. The server lives at `lib/atlas/mcp/` with one tool per file under `lib/atlas/mcp/tools/`, registered in `Atlas.MCP.Server`. External agents (Claude Desktop, Code) rely on this surface to drive Atlas, so it should stay in sync with the in-app feature set.

### Phoenix v1.8 guidelines

- **Always** begin your LiveView templates with `<Layouts.app flash={@flash} ...>` which wraps all inner content
- The `MyAppWeb.Layouts` module is aliased in the `my_app_web.ex` file, so you can use it without needing to alias it again
- Anytime you run into errors with no `current_scope` assign:
  - You failed to follow the Authenticated Routes guidelines, or you failed to pass `current_scope` to `<Layouts.app>`
  - **Always** fix the `current_scope` error by moving your routes to the proper `live_session` and ensure you pass `current_scope` as needed
- Phoenix v1.8 moved the `<.flash_group>` component to the `Layouts` module. You are **forbidden** from calling `<.flash_group>` outside of the `layouts.ex` module
- Out of the box, `core_components.ex` imports an `<.icon name="hero-x-mark" class="w-5 h-5"/>` component for hero icons. **Always** use the `<.icon>` component for icons, **never** use `Heroicons` modules or similar
- **Always** use the imported `<.input>` component for form inputs from `core_components.ex` when available. `<.input>` is imported and using it will save steps and prevent errors
- If you override the default input classes (`<.input class="myclass px-2 py-1 rounded-lg">)`) class with your own values, no default classes are inherited, so your
custom classes must fully style the input

## Elixir guidelines

- Elixir lists **do not support index based access via the access syntax**

  **Never do this (invalid)**:

      i = 0
      mylist = ["blue", "green"]
      mylist[i]

  Instead, **always** use `Enum.at`, pattern matching, or `List` for index based list access, ie:

      i = 0
      mylist = ["blue", "green"]
      Enum.at(mylist, i)

- Elixir variables are immutable, but can be rebound, so for block expressions like `if`, `case`, `cond`, etc
  you *must* bind the result of the expression to a variable if you want to use it and you CANNOT rebind the result inside the expression, ie:

      # INVALID: we are rebinding inside the `if` and the result never gets assigned
      if connected?(socket) do
        socket = assign(socket, :val, val)
      end

      # VALID: we rebind the result of the `if` to a new variable
      socket =
        if connected?(socket) do
          assign(socket, :val, val)
        end

- **Never** nest multiple modules in the same file as it can cause cyclic dependencies and compilation errors
- **Never** use map access syntax (`changeset[:field]`) on structs as they do not implement the Access behaviour by default. For regular structs, you **must** access the fields directly, such as `my_struct.field` or use higher level APIs that are available on the struct if they exist, `Ecto.Changeset.get_field/2` for changesets
- Elixir's standard library has everything necessary for date and time manipulation. Familiarize yourself with the common `Time`, `Date`, `DateTime`, and `Calendar` interfaces by accessing their documentation as necessary. **Never** install additional dependencies unless asked or for date/time parsing (which you can use the `date_time_parser` package)
- Don't use `String.to_atom/1` on user input (memory leak risk)
- Predicate function names should not start with `is_` and should end in a question mark. Names like `is_thing` should be reserved for guards
- Elixir's builtin OTP primitives like `DynamicSupervisor` and `Registry`, require names in the child spec, such as `{DynamicSupervisor, name: MyApp.MyDynamicSup}`, then you can use `DynamicSupervisor.start_child(MyApp.MyDynamicSup, child_spec)`
- Use `Task.async_stream(collection, callback, options)` for concurrent enumeration with back-pressure. The majority of times you will want to pass `timeout: :infinity` as option
- For running external system commands, **always** use `MuonTrap.cmd/3` instead of `System.cmd/3`. MuonTrap propagates process shutdowns to the child process, so a killed BEAM process does not leave orphaned subprocesses
- For temporary files and directories, **always** use `Briefly` (`Briefly.create/1`, `Briefly.create!/1`) instead of building paths under `System.tmp_dir!/0` by hand. Briefly removes the temp file or directory automatically when the owning process exits, so you do not need manual `File.rm/1` cleanup

## Mix guidelines

- Read the docs and options before using tasks (by using `mix help task_name`)
- To debug test failures, run tests in a specific file with `mix test test/my_test.exs` or run all previously failed tests with `mix test --failed`
- `mix deps.clean --all` is **almost never needed**. **Avoid** using it unless you have good reason

## Test guidelines

- Test module names must match the module under test and the test file path. For example, tests for `Atlas.Agents.Identity` belong in `test/atlas/agents/identity_test.exs` as `Atlas.Agents.IdentityTest`; `test/atlas/slack/agent_identity_test.exs` must not define `Atlas.Agents.IdentityTest`.
- **Every test module runs with `async: true`**, enforced by the `Credo.Check.Warning.AsyncTests` check. When a test seems to need `async: false`, the real problem is shared state it reaches outside the SQL sandbox: application environment, a named process, or an ETS table the rest of the suite also sees. Move that behind a function and stub it with Mimic, the way `Atlas.Licenses.Config` and `Atlas.Licenses.RateLimiter` are stubbed, instead of mutating it globally. The one standing exception is `Atlas.Coordination.ClaimsLockTest`, which needs two real database connections to observe row locking and so cannot run inside the sandbox at all.
- **Never insert a literal value into a uniquely indexed column.** The sandbox isolates rows but not index entries: two concurrent tests inserting the same `config_key`, `email`, `channel_id`, `slug`, `audience_key`, or `account_key` block on each other's uncommitted entry, and two inserting the same pair of literals in opposite orders deadlock outright, which surfaces as a rare `40P01 deadlock_detected` on an unrelated test. Derive these from `System.unique_integer([:positive])` in the fixture. When the value is semantically load-bearing, read it back off the inserted record rather than repeating the literal, the way `insert_finance_category!/1` keeps the readable name and scopes only the slug. A value a module shares with itself is fine, since tests inside a module run one at a time; the problem is a value two modules share. A production constant can pin the value, as `"leadership"` does for the brief audience the leadership workers generate by name. That is safe only while no single test writes two such shared values, because one shared value can only serialize while a shared pair is what deadlocks. This rule is not yet true of the whole suite: `account_handles.handle`, `agent_identities.key`, `gtm_opportunities.company_key`, `gtm_audiences.slug`, and `account_invoices.external_id` still carry literals shared across modules, and are worth clearing the same way when you next touch those tests.
- **Always use `start_supervised!/1`** to start processes in tests as it guarantees cleanup between tests
- For temporary files or directories in tests, **always** use ExUnit's `@tag :tmp_dir` and read `%{tmp_dir: tmp_dir}` from the test or `setup` context instead of `System.tmp_dir!/0` with manual naming and `on_exit`/`File.rm` cleanup. ExUnit creates a unique directory per test and manages its lifecycle. (In non-test code, use `Briefly` as noted in the Elixir guidelines.)
- Prefer Mimic over dependency-injecting module functions purely for tests. Do not add production function parameters just to stub collaborators.
- Do not add worker `perform/2` option hooks or other production dependency-injection paths just for tests. Stub module collaborators with Mimic instead.
- **Avoid** `Process.sleep/1` and `Process.alive?/1` in tests
  - Instead of sleeping to wait for a process to finish, **always** use `Process.monitor/1` and assert on the DOWN message:

      ref = Process.monitor(pid)
      assert_receive {:DOWN, ^ref, :process, ^pid, :normal}

   - Instead of sleeping to synchronize before the next call, **always** use `_ = :sys.get_state/1` to ensure the process has handled prior messages

<!-- phoenix:phoenix-start -->
## Phoenix guidelines

- Remember Phoenix router `scope` blocks include an optional alias which is prefixed for all routes within the scope. **Always** be mindful of this when creating routes within a scope to avoid duplicate module prefixes.

- You **never** need to create your own `alias` for route definitions! The `scope` provides the alias, ie:

      scope "/admin", AppWeb.Admin do
        pipe_through :browser

        live "/users", UserLive, :index
      end

  the UserLive route would point to the `AppWeb.Admin.UserLive` module

- `Phoenix.View` no longer is needed or included with Phoenix, don't use it
<!-- phoenix:phoenix-end -->

<!-- phoenix:ecto-start -->
## Ecto Guidelines

- **Always** preload Ecto associations in queries when they'll be accessed in templates, ie a message that needs to reference the `message.user.email`
- Remember `import Ecto.Query` and other supporting modules when you write `seeds.exs`
- `Ecto.Schema` fields always use the `:string` type, even for `:text`, columns, ie: `field :name, :string`
- `Ecto.Changeset.validate_number/2` **DOES NOT SUPPORT the `:allow_nil` option**. By default, Ecto validations only run if a change for the given field exists and the change value is not nil, so such as option is never needed
- You **must** use `Ecto.Changeset.get_field(changeset, :field)` to access changeset fields
- Fields which are set programmatically, such as `user_id`, must not be listed in `cast` calls or similar for security purposes. Instead they must be explicitly set when creating the struct
- **Always** invoke `mix ecto.gen.migration migration_name_using_underscores` when generating migration files, so the correct timestamp and conventions are applied
<!-- phoenix:ecto-end -->

<!-- phoenix:html-start -->
## Phoenix HTML guidelines

- Phoenix templates **always** use `~H` or .html.heex files (known as HEEx), **never** use `~E`
- **Always** use the imported `Phoenix.Component.form/1` and `Phoenix.Component.inputs_for/1` function to build forms. **Never** use `Phoenix.HTML.form_for` or `Phoenix.HTML.inputs_for` as they are outdated
- When building forms **always** use the already imported `Phoenix.Component.to_form/2` (`assign(socket, form: to_form(...))` and `<.form for={@form} id="msg-form">`), then access those forms in the template via `@form[:field]`
- **Always** add unique DOM IDs to key elements (like forms, buttons, etc) when writing templates, these IDs can later be used in tests (`<.form for={@form} id="product-form">`)
- For "app wide" template imports, you can import/alias into the `my_app_web.ex`'s `html_helpers` block, so they will be available to all LiveViews, LiveComponent's, and all modules that do `use MyAppWeb, :html` (replace "my_app" by the actual app name)

- Elixir supports `if/else` but **does NOT support `if/else if` or `if/elsif`**. **Never use `else if` or `elseif` in Elixir**, **always** use `cond` or `case` for multiple conditionals.

  **Never do this (invalid)**:

      <%= if condition do %>
        ...
      <% else if other_condition %>
        ...
      <% end %>

  Instead **always** do this:

      <%= cond do %>
        <% condition -> %>
          ...
        <% condition2 -> %>
          ...
        <% true -> %>
          ...
      <% end %>

- HEEx require special tag annotation if you want to insert literal curly's like `{` or `}`. If you want to show a textual code snippet on the page in a `<pre>` or `<code>` block you *must* annotate the parent tag with `phx-no-curly-interpolation`:

      <code phx-no-curly-interpolation>
        let obj = {key: "val"}
      </code>

  Within `phx-no-curly-interpolation` annotated tags, you can use `{` and `}` without escaping them, and dynamic Elixir expressions can still be used with `<%= ... %>` syntax

- HEEx class attrs support lists, but you must **always** use list `[...]` syntax. You can use the class list syntax to conditionally add classes, **always do this for multiple class values**:

      <a class={[
        "px-2 text-white",
        @some_flag && "py-5",
        if(@other_condition, do: "border-red-500", else: "border-blue-100"),
        ...
      ]}>Text</a>

  and **always** wrap `if`'s inside `{...}` expressions with parens, like done above (`if(@other_condition, do: "...", else: "...")`)

  and **never** do this, since it's invalid (note the missing `[` and `]`):

      <a class={
        "px-2 text-white",
        @some_flag && "py-5"
      }> ...
      => Raises compile syntax error on invalid HEEx attr syntax

- **Never** use `<% Enum.each %>` or non-for comprehensions for generating template content, instead **always** use `<%= for item <- @collection do %>`
- HEEx HTML comments use `<%!-- comment --%>`. **Always** use the HEEx HTML comment syntax for template comments (`<%!-- comment --%>`)
- HEEx allows interpolation via `{...}` and `<%= ... %>`, but the `<%= %>` **only** works within tag bodies. **Always** use the `{...}` syntax for interpolation within tag attributes, and for interpolation of values within tag bodies. **Always** interpolate block constructs (if, cond, case, for) within tag bodies using `<%= ... %>`.

  **Always** do this:

      <div id={@id}>
        {@my_assign}
        <%= if @some_block_condition do %>
          {@another_assign}
        <% end %>
      </div>

  and **Never** do this – the program will terminate with a syntax error:

      <%!-- THIS IS INVALID NEVER EVER DO THIS --%>
      <div id="<%= @invalid_interpolation %>">
        {if @invalid_block_construct do}
        {end}
      </div>
<!-- phoenix:html-end -->

<!-- phoenix:liveview-start -->
## Phoenix LiveView guidelines

- **Never** use the deprecated `live_redirect` and `live_patch` functions, instead **always** use the `<.link navigate={href}>` and  `<.link patch={href}>` in templates, and `push_navigate` and `push_patch` functions LiveViews
- **Avoid LiveComponent's** unless you have a strong, specific need for them
- LiveViews should be named like `AppWeb.WeatherLive`, with a `Live` suffix. When you go to add LiveView routes to the router, the default `:browser` scope is **already aliased** with the `AppWeb` module, so you can just do `live "/weather", WeatherLive`

### LiveView streams

- **Always** use LiveView streams for collections for assigning regular lists to avoid memory ballooning and runtime termination with the following operations:
  - basic append of N items - `stream(socket, :messages, [new_msg])`
  - resetting stream with new items - `stream(socket, :messages, [new_msg], reset: true)` (e.g. for filtering items)
  - prepend to stream - `stream(socket, :messages, [new_msg], at: -1)`
  - deleting items - `stream_delete(socket, :messages, msg)`

- When using the `stream/3` interfaces in the LiveView, the LiveView template must 1) always set `phx-update="stream"` on the parent element, with a DOM id on the parent element like `id="messages"` and 2) consume the `@streams.stream_name` collection and use the id as the DOM id for each child. For a call like `stream(socket, :messages, [new_msg])` in the LiveView, the template would be:

      <div id="messages" phx-update="stream">
        <div :for={{id, msg} <- @streams.messages} id={id}>
          {msg.text}
        </div>
      </div>

- LiveView streams are *not* enumerable, so you cannot use `Enum.filter/2` or `Enum.reject/2` on them. Instead, if you want to filter, prune, or refresh a list of items on the UI, you **must refetch the data and re-stream the entire stream collection, passing reset: true**:

      def handle_event("filter", %{"filter" => filter}, socket) do
        # re-fetch the messages based on the filter
        messages = list_messages(filter)

        {:noreply,
         socket
         |> assign(:messages_empty?, messages == [])
         # reset the stream with the new messages
         |> stream(:messages, messages, reset: true)}
      end

- LiveView streams *do not support counting or empty states*. If you need to display a count, you must track it using a separate assign. For empty states, you can use Tailwind classes:

      <div id="tasks" phx-update="stream">
        <div class="hidden only:block">No tasks yet</div>
        <div :for={{id, task} <- @streams.tasks} id={id}>
          {task.name}
        </div>
      </div>

  The above only works if the empty state is the only HTML block alongside the stream for-comprehension.

- When updating an assign that should change content inside any streamed item(s), you MUST re-stream the items
  along with the updated assign:

      def handle_event("edit_message", %{"message_id" => message_id}, socket) do
        message = Chat.get_message!(message_id)
        edit_form = to_form(Chat.change_message(message, %{content: message.content}))

        # re-insert message so @editing_message_id toggle logic takes effect for that stream item
        {:noreply,
         socket
         |> stream_insert(:messages, message)
         |> assign(:editing_message_id, String.to_integer(message_id))
         |> assign(:edit_form, edit_form)}
      end

  And in the template:

      <div id="messages" phx-update="stream">
        <div :for={{id, message} <- @streams.messages} id={id} class="flex group">
          {message.username}
          <%= if @editing_message_id == message.id do %>
            <%!-- Edit mode --%>
            <.form for={@edit_form} id="edit-form-#{message.id}" phx-submit="save_edit">
              ...
            </.form>
          <% end %>
        </div>
      </div>

- **Never** use the deprecated `phx-update="append"` or `phx-update="prepend"` for collections

### LiveView JavaScript interop

- Remember anytime you use `phx-hook="MyHook"` and that JS hook manages its own DOM, you **must** also set the `phx-update="ignore"` attribute
- **Always** provide an unique DOM id alongside `phx-hook` otherwise a compiler error will be raised

LiveView hooks come in two flavors, 1) colocated js hooks for "inline" scripts defined inside HEEx,
and 2) external `phx-hook` annotations where JavaScript object literals are defined and passed to the `LiveSocket` constructor.

#### Inline colocated js hooks

**Never** write raw embedded `<script>` tags in heex as they are incompatible with LiveView.
Instead, **always use a colocated js hook script tag (`:type={Phoenix.LiveView.ColocatedHook}`)
when writing scripts inside the template**:

    <input type="text" name="user[phone_number]" id="user-phone-number" phx-hook=".PhoneNumber" />
    <script :type={Phoenix.LiveView.ColocatedHook} name=".PhoneNumber">
      export default {
        mounted() {
          this.el.addEventListener("input", e => {
            let match = this.el.value.replace(/\D/g, "").match(/^(\d{3})(\d{3})(\d{4})$/)
            if(match) {
              this.el.value = `${match[1]}-${match[2]}-${match[3]}`
            }
          })
        }
      }
    </script>

- colocated hooks are automatically integrated into the app.js bundle
- colocated hooks names **MUST ALWAYS** start with a `.` prefix, i.e. `.PhoneNumber`

#### External phx-hook

External JS hooks (`<div id="myhook" phx-hook="MyHook">`) must be placed in `assets/js/` and passed to the
LiveSocket constructor:

    const MyHook = {
      mounted() { ... }
    }
    let liveSocket = new LiveSocket("/live", Socket, {
      hooks: { MyHook }
    });

#### Pushing events between client and server

Use LiveView's `push_event/3` when you need to push events/data to the client for a phx-hook to handle.
**Always** return or rebind the socket on `push_event/3` when pushing events:

    # re-bind socket so we maintain event state to be pushed
    socket = push_event(socket, "my_event", %{...})

    # or return the modified socket directly:
    def handle_event("some_event", _, socket) do
      {:noreply, push_event(socket, "my_event", %{...})}
    end

Pushed events can then be picked up in a JS hook with `this.handleEvent`:

    mounted() {
      this.handleEvent("my_event", data => console.log("from server:", data));
    }

Clients can also push an event to the server and receive a reply with `this.pushEvent`:

    mounted() {
      this.el.addEventListener("click", e => {
        this.pushEvent("my_event", { one: 1 }, reply => console.log("got reply from server:", reply));
      })
    }

Where the server handled it via:

    def handle_event("my_event", %{"one" => 1}, socket) do
      {:reply, %{two: 2}, socket}
    end

### LiveView tests

- `Phoenix.LiveViewTest` module and `LazyHTML` (included) for making your assertions
- Form tests are driven by `Phoenix.LiveViewTest`'s `render_submit/2` and `render_change/2` functions
- Come up with a step-by-step test plan that splits major test cases into small, isolated files. You may start with simpler tests that verify content exists, gradually add interaction tests
- **Always reference the key element IDs you added in the LiveView templates in your tests** for `Phoenix.LiveViewTest` functions like `element/2`, `has_element/2`, selectors, etc
- **Never** tests again raw HTML, **always** use `element/2`, `has_element/2`, and similar: `assert has_element?(view, "#my-form")`
- Instead of relying on testing text content, which can change, favor testing for the presence of key elements
- Focus on testing outcomes rather than implementation details
- Be aware that `Phoenix.Component` functions like `<.form>` might produce different HTML than expected. Test against the output HTML structure, not your mental model of what you expect it to be
- When facing test failures with element selectors, add debug statements to print the actual HTML, but use `LazyHTML` selectors to limit the output, ie:

      html = render(view)
      document = LazyHTML.from_fragment(html)
      matches = LazyHTML.filter(document, "your-complex-selector")
      IO.inspect(matches, label: "Matches")

### Form handling

#### Creating a form from params

If you want to create a form based on `handle_event` params:

    def handle_event("submitted", params, socket) do
      {:noreply, assign(socket, form: to_form(params))}
    end

When you pass a map to `to_form/1`, it assumes said map contains the form params, which are expected to have string keys.

You can also specify a name to nest the params:

    def handle_event("submitted", %{"user" => user_params}, socket) do
      {:noreply, assign(socket, form: to_form(user_params, as: :user))}
    end

#### Creating a form from changesets

When using changesets, the underlying data, form params, and errors are retrieved from it. The `:as` option is automatically computed too. E.g. if you have a user schema:

    defmodule MyApp.Users.User do
      use Ecto.Schema
      ...
    end

And then you create a changeset that you pass to `to_form`:

    %MyApp.Users.User{}
    |> Ecto.Changeset.change()
    |> to_form()

Once the form is submitted, the params will be available under `%{"user" => user_params}`.

In the template, the form form assign can be passed to the `<.form>` function component:

    <.form for={@form} id="todo-form" phx-change="validate" phx-submit="save">
      <.input field={@form[:field]} type="text" />
    </.form>

Always give the form an explicit, unique DOM ID, like `id="todo-form"`.

#### Avoiding form errors

**Always** use a form assigned via `to_form/2` in the LiveView, and the `<.input>` component in the template. In the template **always access forms this**:

    <%!-- ALWAYS do this (valid) --%>
    <.form for={@form} id="my-form">
      <.input field={@form[:field]} type="text" />
    </.form>

And **never** do this:

    <%!-- NEVER do this (invalid) --%>
    <.form for={@changeset} id="my-form">
      <.input field={@changeset[:field]} type="text" />
    </.form>

- You are FORBIDDEN from accessing the changeset in the template as it will cause errors
- **Never** use `<.form let={f} ...>` in the template, instead **always use `<.form for={@form} ...>`**, then drive all form references from the form assign as in `@form[:field]`. The UI should **always** be driven by a `to_form/2` assigned in the LiveView module that is derived from a changeset
