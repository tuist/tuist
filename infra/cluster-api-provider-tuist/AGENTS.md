# cluster-api-provider-tuist

Cluster API infrastructure provider that joins Scaleway and OVH nodes as
workers into the existing caph/Hetzner clusters, surfaced through
CAPI's standard Machine/MachineDeployment shape. It manages four
machine kinds:

- `ScalewayAppleSiliconMachine` — Mac minis (Tart), SSH-bootstrapped
  with tart-cri/tart-kubelet.
- `ScalewayElasticMetalMachine` — Scaleway Linux bare metal (e.g. the
  `kura-scw-fr-par` runner-cache node), SSH self-join (Elastic Metal
  has no user-data channel); adopts a pre-ordered box and
  **reinstalls it (wipe) on release**.
- `DediboxMachine` — Scaleway Dedibox bare metal (eu-central); adopts a
  pre-prepped box, left installed on release.
- `OVHDedicatedMachine` — OVHcloud US bare metal (us-east / us-west);
  adopts a pre-prepped box, left installed on release.

All bootstrap with an operator-minted kubelet identity + SSH self-join,
then wait for `Node.Ready`. The three Linux kinds share the
`controllers/linux` package and bind that identity to `system:node`;
Apple Silicon uses the `tart-kubelet` role. The Elastic Metal kind is
designed in `docs/scaleway-elastic-metal-support.md`; the sections below
detail the Apple Silicon kind.

## CRDs

| Kind | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `ScalewayAppleSiliconMachine` | One Mac mini. Has the Scaleway server type, zone, OS, per-host pod CIDR, fleet name (ties Machines on the same fleet to one shared SSH key), and kubelet version. SSH and bootstrap material are operator-managed — no Secret refs in the spec. |
| `ScalewayAppleSiliconMachineTemplate` | Template MachineDeployments / MachineSets clone from. |
| `ScalewayElasticMetalMachine` (+ `…Template`) | One Scaleway Elastic Metal server (Linux bare metal): offer type, zone, OS, PN id, node taints, `fleetName`. SSH self-join (no user-data channel); local-NVMe (`scw-local-nvme`) cache. Reinstall-on-release. |
| `DediboxMachine` (+ `…Template`) | One Scaleway Dedibox bare-metal server (eu-central): adopts a pre-prepped box by tag, `fleetName`. Left installed on release. |
| `OVHDedicatedMachine` (+ `…Template`) | One OVHcloud US bare-metal server (us-east / us-west): adopts a pre-prepped box by displayName prefix, `fleetName`. Left installed on release. |
| `TuistCluster` | Cluster-level stub (CAPI core requires it for the parent Cluster to validate). Sets `Status.Ready=true` once it exists. Shared by all machine kinds. |

API group: `infrastructure.cluster.x-k8s.io/v1alpha1`. Short names:
`samm`, `sammt`, `sasc`.

```

The MachineReconciler is idempotent at every stage: re-running on a
partially-bootstrapped host completes the missing steps without
redoing finished ones. Failures requeue with backoff; only terminal
errors (Scaleway 400s, validation failures) set
`Status.FailureReason`.

Beyond first bootstrap, a drift loop re-pushes host config to already-Ready
hosts when the operator's `bootstrap.HostConfigHash` differs from the
Machine's `Status.HostConfigHash`. That hash is a fleet-wide fingerprint over
everything the operator pushes — the rendered install scripts plus the
embedded binaries (tart-kubelet, tailscale, node_exporter) — computed once at
startup from operator-image + fleet-config inputs with every per-host field
zeroed. So shipping a new operator image with a changed script, fleet CIDR/tag,
or re-baked binary rolls to existing hosts on the next reconcile, not only on a
tart-kubelet binary change. The re-push is zero-downtime (running Tart VMs
survive `UpdateTartKubelet`). Terminal-failed CRs are excluded until
`Status.FailureReason` is cleared.

Two auxiliary controllers run alongside it:

- **OrphanReclaimer** (`controllers/orphan_reclaimer.go`) — a
  leader-gated periodic sweep that returns Scaleway hosts which were
  claimed by the controller but whose CR is gone (a legacy CR that
  skipped release, a force-delete that bypassed the finalizer, a crash
  mid-claim) back to the adopt pool, so a strand can't silently drain
  the pool and keep billing under Apple's 24h floor. The per-Machine
  delete path only covers what reaches it; the sweep is the convergent
  backstop. A host is left untouched unless it is certainly
  ours-but-unowned — not in the pool, not mid-adoption, and named after
  no live CR (the claim renames a pool host to its CR's name, so a live
  CR name is the authoritative "owned" signal). Active reclaim is gated
  on a claim-name prefix; report-only otherwise. Exports the
  `scaleway_orphan_servers` gauge. Enabled by
  `macosFleet.orphanReclaim.poolPrefix`, which also serves as the
  delete path's pool-prefix fallback for legacy CRs.
- **FleetSpreadReconciler** (`controllers/fleetspread_controller.go`) —
  re-rolls a target Deployment when the Ready Mac mini set changes so
  Pods spread across newly-joined hosts.

CRDs live in [`infra/helm/tuist/crds/`](../helm/tuist/crds/) so Helm
installs them automatically on first `helm install` (Helm 3 ignores
the `crds/` directory on upgrades, which is what we want — CRD
schema changes go through a deliberate `kubectl apply` rather than
piggybacking on routine deploys).

## Operator UX: one Secret in 1Password

The only thing an operator manages by hand is **Scaleway IAM
credentials in 1Password**. The chart's `ExternalSecret` template
syncs those into a cluster Secret automatically; everything else is
operator-managed:

| Secret | Source | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `<release>-capi-scaleway-applesilicon` | 1Password → ESO | Scaleway API auth for the operator. Three fields: `access-key`, `secret-key`, `project-id`. |
| `<fleet-name>-ssh` | **Generated by the operator on first reconcile** | Per-fleet Ed25519 SSH keypair. The operator registers the public half with Scaleway via the IAM API, stores the private half here. The chart doesn't reference this Secret directly. |
| Bootstrap material | **Minted by the operator on each Machine reconcile** | API server URL + CA cert read from the operator pod's in-cluster service-account context. Bootstrap token created as a `bootstrap.kubernetes.io/token` Secret in `kube-system` with 24h TTL. No 1Password entry, no manual rotation. |

Day-1 operator runbook:

1. **Drop Scaleway IAM creds in 1Password.** One item per env in the
   matching `tuist-k8s-<env>` vault — same convention as
   `MASTER_KEY`, `PROCESSOR_DATABASE_PASSWORD`, and
   `KUBEADM_BOOTSTRAP_TOKEN`:

   - `op://tuist-k8s-staging/SCALEWAY_API/{access-key,secret-key,project-id}`
   - `op://tuist-k8s-canary/SCALEWAY_API/{access-key,secret-key,project-id}`
   - `op://tuist-k8s-production/SCALEWAY_API/{access-key,secret-key,project-id}`

   Each env gets its own Scaleway IAM application scoped to that
   cluster's needs; a leaked staging key rotates without disrupting
   production. The IAM policy attached to that application needs
   these permission sets, all at project scope:

   - `AppleSiliconFullAccess` — order/release Mac minis, list server
     types and OS images (the Apple Silicon fleets).
   - `ElasticMetalFullAccess` — list/order/release Elastic Metal
     servers (the kura runner-cache fleet). Elastic Metal is a
     **separate Scaleway product** from Apple Silicon; without this
     set the EM reconciler 403s on its first `list elastic metal
     servers` call and never orders a node, so the cache stays down
     and a deploy waiting on the fleet hangs.
   - `PrivateNetworksFullAccess` — attach servers to the runner-cache
     Private Network (find-or-created by name).
   - `IPAMReadOnly` — read the PN-assigned address the self-join uses.
   - `SSHKeysFullAccess` — register the per-fleet Ed25519 public key
     the operator generates on first reconcile. **Do not use
     `IAMManager`** despite the name suggesting it covers SSH keys;
     Scaleway gates `ssh_key` write under `SSHKeysFullAccess`
     specifically.

   Each cluster's pre-configured `ClusterSecretStore "onepassword"` is
   already scoped to the right vault, so the chart references the
   bare item name and ESO picks the correct vault automatically.

2. **Set the chart values** (managed cloud — defaults shown):

   ```yaml
   macosFleet:
     enabled: true
     controlPlane:
       host: api.tuist.dev
     scaleway:
       externalSecrets:
         item: SCALEWAY_API   # bare item name; vault from ClusterSecretStore
   ```

3. **Deploy.**

   ```bash
   helm upgrade tuist infra/helm/tuist -f ...
   ```

That's it. The MachineDeployment's `replicas` field controls the
fleet size from there. No `kubectl create secret` calls.

## Build

```bash
cd infra/cluster-api-provider-tuist
go test ./...
go build ./...
docker build -f Dockerfile -t ghcr.io/tuist/capi-provider-scaleway-applesilicon:dev ../..
```

The Dockerfile is multi-stage: it cross-builds tart-cri + tart-cni
for darwin/arm64 (so the manager can ship them to Mac minis at
bootstrap time) and builds the manager itself for whatever
linux/<arch> the cluster runs on.

## Operating

### Bring a pre-ordered bare-metal box into the pool (Dedibox / OVH)

The Dedibox and OVH kinds adopt a *pre-prepared* box rather than ordering or
installing one, the same shape as the Apple Silicon fleet. **Adoption is a claim
+ SSH self-join only; the OS install never runs on the adoption path** (that is
what keeps a *claimed* box's self-join fast). A box must be installed (Ubuntu +
the fleet key + a known sudo password) and marked *before* it joins the pool. The
`baremetal:prep-*` tasks do the install and the marking in one step.

**Prerequisites, per env, in the `tuist-k8s-<env>` 1Password vault:**

- Provider API token:
  - OVH: `OVH_API` with fields `application-key` / `application-secret` /
    `consumer-key`, minted on the **same entity** as the fleet's `endpoint` (the
    US boxes live on OVHcloud US, so `ovh-us` / api.us.ovhcloud.com; a token
    minted on a different entity reads as "invalid"). It must be scoped for the
    whole flow, not just reinstall: a reinstall-only token still 403s on naming
    (`PUT /service/*`) and can't read the displayName for adoption
    (`GET /services/*`). Mint it with this pre-filled link (OVH US):
    `https://api.us.ovhcloud.com/createToken/?GET=/dedicated/server&GET=/dedicated/server/*&GET=/services/*&GET=/service/*&GET=/me/*&POST=/dedicated/server/*&POST=/me/*&PUT=/service/*`
  - Dedibox: `DEDIBOX_SCW_API` with fields `secret-key` / `project-id`.
  - Exactly one item per title per vault. A duplicate makes `op read` (prep) and
    ESO ambiguous and wedges both.
- Fleet SSH key, when the fleet sets `sshExternalSecret.enabled: true` (the
  current default for managed fleets): a 1Password item (`OVH_FLEET_SSH` /
  `DEDIBOX_FLEET_SSH`) with fields `private-key` / `public-key` / `sudo-password`.
  ESO syncs it to the `<fleet>-ssh` Secret, and the prep task reads the key
  material straight from 1Password (no cluster access needed). Legacy fleets that
  still mint the key in-cluster use `baremetal:mint-fleet-key` instead.

**Steps:**

1. **Pre-order the box** in the provider console (out of band; the controllers
   never order). OVH ADVANCE-1 for the US regions, Dedibox for eu-central.
2. **Prep it.** Installs Ubuntu + the fleet key + sudo password, then sets the
   adoption marker as its final step, reading the tag / displayName prefix from
   `values-managed-<env>.yaml`. The install is async (~20-40 min; poll the
   console). `PREP_NAMESPACE` selects the env (hence the `tuist-k8s-<env>` vault
   and the values file); the OVH second arg is the fleet name:
   ```bash
   PREP_NAMESPACE=tuist-production mise run baremetal:prep-dedibox 184798
   PREP_NAMESPACE=tuist-production mise run baremetal:prep-ovh ns1034936.ip-40-160-72.us tuist-tuist-ovh-fleet-us-east
   ```
   Pass `PREP_SKIP_MARK=1` to stage capacity without marking it in yet, then
   release it later with `baremetal:mark-dedibox` / `baremetal:mark-ovh` (those
   are also the tasks to re-name a box).
3. **Declare the fleet at `replicas: 1`** in `values-managed-<env>.yaml` and
   deploy. The controller claims the marked box and self-joins it in ~2-5 min.
   `replicas` here is the **box** count (one per region today); a region's
   KuraInstance runs its own pod replicas on top of the box. Because the box is
   prepped before the deploy, the fleet can come up at 1 directly. Only a *true*
   cold start (deploying before any box is prepped) needs the old `replicas: 0`
   then-scale dance, since an enabled fleet with no adoptable box sits at MD 0/1
   and wedges `helm --wait` (the `dig`-based template preserves an explicit 0).

**Fleet naming.** The singular `ovhFleet` renders `tuist-tuist-ovh-fleet` and
`dediboxFleet` renders `tuist-tuist-dedibox-fleet`. Additional OVH regions live
in the `ovhFleets` map and render `tuist-tuist-ovh-fleet-<key>` (e.g.
`tuist-tuist-ovh-fleet-us-east`). The adopt marker comes from that fleet's
values: `adoptTag` (Dedibox) or `adoptDisplayNamePrefix` (OVH, a prefix match).
Production today: tag `tuist-kura-production` (eu-central), displayName prefixes
`tuist-kura-ovh-production-us-east` / `-us-west` (OVH).

Release (`reconcileDelete`) drops the Node + identity + TOFU pin but **leaves the
box installed** (it is a monthly contract, not a reinstall-on-release); a released
box keeps its OS + key, so re-marking it back into the pool re-claims it with no
re-prep.

### Scale up
```bash
kubectl scale machinedeployment <fleet-name> --replicas=4
```
Two new ScalewayAppleSiliconMachines are created → operator orders
two Mac minis from Scaleway → ~5 min later `kubectl get nodes` shows
them Ready.

### Scale down
```bash
kubectl scale machinedeployment <fleet-name> --replicas=1
```
CAPI core picks the most-recently-created Machines for deletion. The
controller renames the host back into the pool namespace
(`<poolPrefix><uuid>`) and triggers a Scaleway OS reinstall; the
host stays alive, returns to factory-default state, and becomes
eligible for the next adoption once Scaleway flips it back to
`Delivered + Ready`. The 24h Apple licensing floor stays in
operator-owned territory — you keep paying for capacity you already
pre-ordered until you decide to release it via the Scaleway console.

### Replace a wedged host
```bash
kubectl delete machine <machine-name>
```
The MachineSet immediately creates a replacement; the old Mac mini
is renamed back into the pool, reinstalled, and re-eligible for the
next adoption. The replacement Machine will adopt either this host
(post-reinstall) or any other available pool host, whichever
Scaleway returns to `Ready` first.

If the host is genuinely broken (kernel panic loop, hardware fault,
retired SKU) and must not be re-adopted, release it via the
Scaleway console before deleting the Machine — the controller has
no physical-terminate path.

### Investigate a failure
```bash
kubectl describe scalewayapplesiliconmachine <name>
# Check Conditions (Provisioned / Bootstrapped) and Events (lifecycle
# transitions, drift-loop attempts, terminal-failure transitions)
kubectl get events --field-selector involvedObject.kind=ScalewayAppleSiliconMachine
```

### Make `kubectl logs`/`exec` work on a fleet node

The apiserver reaches a node's kubelet on `:10250` directly, so `kubectl logs`,
`exec`, `attach`, and `port-forward` against a fleet node (Dedibox / Scaleway
Elastic Metal / OVH) depend on three things being right at once. They fail with a
*different* symptom per layer — diagnose by the error, not by guessing:

| Symptom on `kubectl logs <fleet-pod>` | Layer | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `dial tcp: lookup <node> … no such host` | 1. apiserver dials the unresolvable Hostname because its `--kubelet-preferred-address-types` lacks `InternalIP` | declarative: the Cluster-CR variable + mgmt-apply roll the CP (below) |
| `remote error: tls: internal error` | 2. kubelet has no serving cert (`serverTLSBootstrap` + unapprovable SA-identity CSR) | converges automatically (drift loop); re-provision to force |
| `401`/anonymous / `Unauthorized` | 3. kubelet has no `clientCAFile`, so the apiserver's client cert isn't trusted | converges automatically (drift loop); re-provision to force |

Layers 2 and 3 are fixed in `controllers/linux/linux_cloudinit.go` (self-signed
serving cert + cluster CA on disk as `clientCAFile`) and **converge onto existing
nodes automatically** via the kubelet-config drift loop
(`controllers/linux/kubelet_config_drift.go`): each already-Ready node carries a
`tuist.dev/kubelet-config-hash` annotation, and when the rendered config changes
(new operator image) the controller SSHes a minimal, zero-downtime re-push
(rewrite `/var/lib/kubelet/{ca.crt,config.yaml}` + `systemctl restart kubelet` —
containerd, apt, and the `/data` mounts are untouched, so running pods survive).
So after the provider image rolls, the fleet picks up the config on the next
reconcile with **no manual step**. Confirm convergence:

```bash
# The node's stamped hash appears once the re-push has run:
kubectl get node <fleet-node> -o jsonpath='{.metadata.annotations.tuist\.dev/kubelet-config-hash}'
```

To force it immediately (or if a node is stuck), re-provision — the MachineSet
re-creates + re-joins it on the current image, cache re-warms from the mesh
(non-disruptive, same as "Replace a wedged host"):

```bash
kubectl delete machine <fleet-machine-name>
```

**Two Elastic Metal re-provision gotchas** (from recovering the kura node):
- The drift-loop re-push — and any re-provision — SSHes into the box with the fleet
  key, so it only works if that key is authorized on the host. Reconcile showing
  `ssh: unable to authenticate, attempted methods [none publickey]` means the box
  doesn't hold the operator's current fleet key, so the drift loop **cannot**
  self-heal it. On Elastic Metal the box is re-authorized only at (re)install, and
  `kubectl delete machine` reinstalls it with the key of `machine.Spec.FleetName`
  — so make sure the machine has `fleetName` set. A machine with an **empty**
  `fleetName` uses a throwaway *per-machine* key (`<ns>-<machine>-ssh`) that churns
  on every recreate and can leave the box holding a key that doesn't match the
  shared fleet key the next machine presents. `kura-fleet.yaml` sets `fleetName`; a
  live machine cloned before that was added keeps the empty value until recreated.
- A freshly-reinstalled EM box can then fail to bootstrap at package install
  (`run bootstrap … exited with status 100`) because DNS is broken: Scaleway's PN
  DHCP writes `/etc/resolv.conf` with only `nameserver 169.254.169.254` (the
  metadata/PN resolver), which the box firewalls off (`permission denied`), so apt
  can't reach the mirror — even though public egress + public resolvers work.
  Tactical unblock (SSH in as `ubuntu` with the fleet key): replace that line with
  `nameserver 1.1.1.1`. Not durable (a DHCP renewal can revert it); the real fix
  belongs in the EM bootstrap — after PN attach, ensure resolv.conf carries a
  reachable resolver instead of only the blocked metadata address.

Layer 1 is Cluster-CR config that **rolls declaratively — there is no separate
workflow or manual trigger**. The apiserver flag comes from the
`kubeletPreferredAddressTypes` variable (already `ExternalIP,InternalIP,Hostname,…`
per env in `infra/k8s/clusters/cluster-<env>.yaml`); a ClusterClass patch rebuilds
the KCP's `apiServer.extraArgs` from it, and per that patch's own contract,
**setting the variable regenerates the KubeadmControlPlane and rolls its CP**. So
applying the Cluster CR through `mgmt-cluster-apply` (push to `main` touching
`infra/k8s/clusters/**`) is the whole mechanism — kubeadm bakes the flag into the
apiserver static-pod manifest as the new CP machine joins.

If a fleet node still dials the Hostname after that apply, the roll didn't
*complete* — almost always a **wedged/stuck KCP**, not a missing trigger. Diagnose:

```bash
# WORKLOAD cluster: is the running apiserver actually missing InternalIP?
kubectl -n kube-system get pod -l component=kube-apiserver \
  -o jsonpath='{.items[0].spec.containers[0].command}' | tr ',' '\n' | grep preferred-address

# MGMT cluster: does the KCP's desired config already carry InternalIP?
kubectl -n <cluster-ns> get kubeadmcontrolplane <kcp-name> \
  -o jsonpath='{.spec.kubeadmConfigSpec.clusterConfiguration.apiServer.extraArgs}'

# If yes but the CP never rolled, the KCP is stuck — look for a blocked roll
# (RollingOut=True + ScalingUp blocked / MachinesReady=False behind a CP Machine
# that has no Node). A `rolloutAfter` bump will NOT move a wedged KCP; fix the wedge
# first (delete the dead CP Machine + orphaned infra so it can reconcile a healthy CP).
kubectl -n <cluster-ns> describe kubeadmcontrolplane <kcp-name>
```

Do not reach for a manual `rolloutAfter` patch as the primary path: the variable
apply already rolls a healthy KCP, and `rolloutAfter` can't roll a wedged one.
`rolloutAfter` is only for forcing a roll with *no* config change (cert rotation,
recovering a bad node), against a healthy KCP.

Emergency Layer-1 bypass (a single wedged CP, e.g. staging): edit the running
apiserver static pod directly — add `InternalIP` to
`--kubelet-preferred-address-types` in
`/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml` on the CP node (`kubectl debug
node/<cp>` → `chroot /host`; back the file up *outside* `manifests/`, swap
atomically, verify the apiserver returns on `:6443`). The KCP is external and never
rewrites static-pod files on a running node, so the edit persists until the CP is
rebuilt (which then carries `InternalIP` from the KCP config anyway).

Verify end-to-end (Layers 1+2+3):

```bash
kubectl -n kube-system logs <pod-on-a-fleet-node> --tail=5   # streams (not a dial error)
kubectl exec <pod-on-a-fleet-node> -- true                   # exec works
```

### Unstick a host whose CAPI bootstrap is failing on sudo

Symptom: `kubectl describe scalewayapplesiliconmachine <name>` shows
`BootstrappedCondition=False` with a message containing `sudo:`
errors, or the bootstrap looping on early SSH steps after Stage 1
provisioning succeeded.

Root cause is almost always: the operator-stored `m1` password in
the bootstrap Secret has drifted from what's actually set on the
host (Scaleway-issued password rotated, host got reinstalled,
controller crashed mid-store, etc.). CAPI's bootstrap can SSH in
(fleet key works) but can't `sudo -S` to install
`/etc/sudoers.d/m1-nopasswd`, so every subsequent step fails.

Recovery: run `prepare-fleet-host` to install the sudoers entry
out-of-band using the operator-provided current password.

```bash
# Get the live m1 password from Scaleway:
scw apple-silicon server get <server-id> zone=<zone> -o json \
  | jq -r .vnc_url
# (Password is between `m1:` and `@` in the vnc:// URL.)

# Then:
mise run k8s:prepare-fleet-host <env> <fleet-name> <host-ip>
```

The script SSHes in with the fleet key (which Scaleway auto-injects
at first boot via project-level keys), prompts for the password,
installs `/etc/sudoers.d/m1-nopasswd` and `/etc/kcpassword` /
`autoLoginUser`. After that, CAPI's bootstrap proceeds without ever
needing a correct password in its Secret.

If the fleet pubkey isn't on the host (rare — Scaleway didn't
inject), the script's SSH probe fails with `Permission denied`.
Recover by VNC'ing into the host and pasting the pubkey into
`~/.ssh/scw_authorized_keys`, then re-running the script. Don't
bother with `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` — Scaleway's `sshd_config`
reads both files, but `scw_authorized_keys` is the one the
first-boot injection writes to, so anything you add there
mirrors the auto-inject convention.

### Detach a CR without releasing its Scaleway host

Reserved for recovering from a duplicate-claim state (multiple CRs
ended up bound to the same Scaleway server) or for hand-rolling a CR
off a host that's actively serving traffic. The standard
`kubectl delete machine <name>` path always calls Scaleway's
`ReleaseToPool` against the bound host (rename + reinstall), which
is the wrong move when the host is shared OR you want to keep its
current state intact.

The reconciler skips Scaleway release whenever `status.serverID` is
empty at delete time. But clearing `status.serverID` before the
delete races the reconcile loop — it sees the empty serverID and
runs `AdoptFromPool` against the pool. To latch the loop off
during cleanup, set the CAPI `cluster.x-k8s.io/paused` annotation
on the CR *before* clearing status:

```bash
NS=tuist
NAME=tuist-tuist-runners-fleet-mndbc-xxxxx

# 1. Latch the reconciler off — annotate FIRST. Until this lands,
#    every subsequent patch is racing.
kubectl -n "$NS" annotate scalewayapplesiliconmachine "$NAME" \
  cluster.x-k8s.io/paused=true --overwrite

# 2. Clear status.serverID (so reconcileDelete skips ReleaseToPool)
#    and spec.providerID (so CAPI core doesn't keep referencing
#    the abandoned binding).
kubectl -n "$NS" patch scalewayapplesiliconmachine "$NAME" \
  --subresource=status --type=merge -p '{"status":{"serverID":""}}'
kubectl -n "$NS" patch scalewayapplesiliconmachine "$NAME" \
  --type=merge -p '{"spec":{"providerID":null}}'

# 3. Delete the parent Machine. The pause annotation only latches
#    reconcileNormal — reconcileDelete still runs on
#    DeletionTimestamp regardless, observes the empty serverID,
#    and skips the Scaleway release.
kubectl -n "$NS" delete machine "$NAME"
```

The MachineSet will create a replacement CR with a fresh suffix,
which adopts an unclaimed pool host on its next reconcile.

After cleanup, if you renamed the original Scaleway host
out-of-band (e.g. during a duplicate-claim untangling), rename it
back so the pool prefix matches and a future `AdoptFromPool` can
pick it up:

```bash
scw apple-silicon server update <id> zone=<zone> name=tuist-pool-...
```
