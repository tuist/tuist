# Tuist Platform Helm Chart

Platform-level Helm umbrella chart installed **once per Kubernetes cluster** that hosts the Tuist-managed deployment. It bundles the infrastructure that our per-app chart (`infra/helm/tuist/`) assumes is already running.

## What's in it

| Component | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `cert-manager` | TLS certificate issuance via Let's Encrypt + Cloudflare DNS-01 |
| `ingress-nginx` | Ingress controller backed by a cloud LoadBalancer |
| `external-dns` | Sync Ingress / Service hostnames into Cloudflare DNS |
| `external-secrets` | Pull secrets from external stores (1Password, SOPS, etc.) into the cluster |
| `ClusterIssuer` | Shared Let's Encrypt issuer wired to Cloudflare DNS-01 |

## Bootstrap

```bash
# 1. Create the target namespace.
kubectl create namespace platform

# 2. Create the Cloudflare API token Secret out-of-band. The token must have
#    Zone.DNS:Edit scope on the managed zone(s). Never commit this value.
kubectl -n platform create secret generic cloudflare-api-token \
  --from-literal=api-token="$CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN"

# 3. Fetch chart dependencies.
helm dependency update infra/helm/platform

# 4. Install the platform.
helm upgrade --install platform infra/helm/platform \
  -n platform
```

## Local validation

```bash
helm dependency update infra/helm/platform
helm template platform infra/helm/platform | kubectl apply --dry-run=client -f -
helm lint infra/helm/platform
```

## Notes

- The ingress-nginx LoadBalancer is annotated for Hetzner Cloud (Nuremberg region) by default. Adjust `ingress-nginx.controller.service.annotations` when the cluster lands on a different provider.
- external-dns is scoped by `txtOwnerId: tuist-platform` — one cluster, one TXT prefix. Run it with `policy: sync` only if you're happy with it deleting DNS records that aren't tracked by any Ingress.
- cert-manager CRDs are installed by the subchart (`installCRDs: true`). If another tool manages them, turn that off.
