# Network {#network}

This page covers network-related configuration that may be needed when integrating Tuist with your infrastructure.

## Outbound IP addresses {#outbound-ip-addresses}

If your infrastructure restricts inbound traffic by IP address, you may need to allowlist the IP ranges used by Tuist. This is common when Tuist needs to communicate with services behind a firewall or VPN, such as self-hosted Git providers or artifact storage, or when your GitHub organization uses [IP allow lists](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/keeping-your-organization-secure/managing-security-settings-for-your-organization/managing-allowed-ip-addresses-for-your-organization).

Tuist outbound network traffic that reaches customer infrastructure originates from the following stable IP address:

| IP range | CIDR notation |
|---|---|
| 116.202.0.10 | `116.202.0.10/32` |

> [!TIP]
> Add this range to your allowlist to ensure uninterrupted connectivity with Tuist services.
