Tuist's Gradle plugin can send build analytics to Tuist, giving you visibility into task execution and build performance.

## Configure upload behavior {#configure-upload-behavior}

By default:
- Build analytics are uploaded in the background for local builds.
- Build analytics are uploaded in the foreground for CI runs to avoid losing telemetry on short-lived agents.

You can control this behavior using `uploadInBackground` inside the `tuist` extension:

```kotlin
tuist {
    uploadInBackground = false // always upload in the foreground
}
```

## Configuration reference {#configuration-reference}

The `uploadInBackground` option is available in the `tuist` extension block in `settings.gradle.kts`:

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `uploadInBackground` | `Boolean?` | `null` (background locally, foreground on CI) | Whether to upload build insights in the background for local builds. |

This setting does not affect remote cache settings in the `buildCache` block.
