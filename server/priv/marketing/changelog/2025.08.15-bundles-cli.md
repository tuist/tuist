Tuist now provides CLI commands to view and inspect bundles uploaded to your projects:

```bash
# List bundles in the current project
tuist bundle list

# List bundles in a specific project
tuist bundle list --project account/project

# Output bundle list as JSON for scripting
tuist bundle list --json

# View detailed information about a specific bundle
tuist bundle show {id}
```

These commands handle authentication and session management automatically, making it easy to integrate bundle operations into your CI/CD pipelines and custom automation workflows.
