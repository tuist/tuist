Track the complete history of state changes for each test case. The new Test History tab shows a timeline of events including when a test was first seen, when it was marked or unmarked as flaky, and when it was quarantined or unquarantined. Each event shows who made the change - whether it was done manually by a team member or automatically by Tuist.
