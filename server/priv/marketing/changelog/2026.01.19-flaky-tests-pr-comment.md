Flaky tests detected during your CI runs are now surfaced directly in Tuist's pull request comments. The new "Flaky Tests" section shows a summary of flaky tests per test scheme with a link to view all flaky runs. This makes it easier to spot and address flaky tests without leaving your pull request.
