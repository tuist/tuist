title: Flaky Tests in PR Comments
category: "Product"

Flaky tests detected during your CI runs are now surfaced directly in Tuist's pull request comments. The new "Flaky Tests" section shows a summary of flaky tests per test scheme with a link to view all flaky runs, and displays up to 5 flaky test cases with links to their detail pages. This makes it easier to spot and address flaky tests without leaving your pull request.
