In response to recent [feedback on our pricing](https://community.tuist.io/t/presenting-our-new-website-and-domain-tuist-dev/183/3) (thanks [Vijay](https://community.tuist.io/u/vijaytholpadi)) and to better align with [our philosophy](/blog/2024/11/05/our-pricing-philosophy), we've made some updates to our pricing model.

Transitioning from Tuist Air to Tuist Pro is now simplerâ€”just add a payment method, and you'll only be charged for usage exceeding the defined thresholds. To make everything clearer, we've included [a table](/pricing) outlining how the usage of various features is measured.

Looking ahead, we plan to provide examples, an estimation calculator, and tools to help you set usage limits, so you can stay within your budget and enjoy peace of mind.
