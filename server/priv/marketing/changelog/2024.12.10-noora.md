Over the years of developing the [Tuist CLI](https://github.com/tuist/tuist){:target="_blank"}, we’ve come to appreciate the value of consistent UI patterns across all aspects of the tool (like commands) in delivering an outstanding developer experience. Unfortunately, this is an area we overlooked for a while. Recently, we’ve taken steps to address this, not only to enhance the Tuist CLI experience but also to establish a foundation for other CLIs we’re building. Our goal is to ensure they all share a unified Tuist look and feel, while also adhering to excellent accessibility and UI practices.

To achieve this, we’ve introduced [Noora](https://github.com/tuist/noora){:target="_blank"}—a design system for building CLIs in Swift. This Swift package provides themable components designed specifically for CLI interfaces. While the current selection of components is limited, we plan to gradually expand it by extracting more components from our work at Tuist.

If you’re building a CLI in Swift, we encourage you to explore [the documentation](https://noora.tuist.dev){:target="_blank"}. We’d love to hear your feedback and welcome contributions to make Noora even better. If there’s a specific component you need, feel free to open an issue or submit a PR!
