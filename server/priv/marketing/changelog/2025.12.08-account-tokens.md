You can now create fine-grained account tokens with specific scopes and project access. Unlike project tokens, account tokens let you control exactly which operations the token can perform and which projects it can access.

```bash
tuist account tokens create my-account --scopes project:cache:read project:cache:write --name ci-cache-token --expires 1y
```

Account tokens support various scopes covering cache, previews, builds, tests, bundles, registry, and account management. You can also set expiration dates and restrict tokens to specific projects within an account.
