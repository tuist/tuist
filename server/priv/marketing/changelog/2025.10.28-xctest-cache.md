title: XCTest and Swift Testing targets are now cacheable
category: "Product"
---

We've removed the restriction that prevented caching of targets that depend on XCTest or Swift Testing frameworks. This means your test targets and any targets that depend on them can now be cached, significantly improving build times for projects with testing dependencies.

Previously, these targets were always rebuilt from source. Now they benefit from the same caching optimizations as your other targets, making your test builds faster and more efficient.
