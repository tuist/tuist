You can now attach custom metadata to your builds using environment variables. Filter builds by tags to analyze specific build categories like nightly builds, team-specific builds, or release candidates.

Set `TUIST_BUILD_TAGS` or `TUIST_BUILD_TAG_*` environment variables before running `tuist inspect build`, and use the new Tag filter in the dashboard to slice your build analytics.
