title: OIDC authentication for CI environments
category: "Product"
---

You can now authenticate with Tuist in CI environments using OpenID Connect (OIDC) tokens. This eliminates the need to manage long-lived secrets - just connect your GitHub repository to your Tuist project and run `tuist auth login` in your CI workflow.

```yaml
name: Build
on: [push]

permissions:
  id-token: write
  contents: read

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: macos-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: jdx/mise-action@v2
      - run: tuist auth login
      - run: tuist generate
```

OIDC authentication is currently supported on GitHub Actions, CircleCI, and Bitrise. See the [CI integration documentation](https://docs.tuist.dev/en/guides/integrations/continuous-integration) for setup instructions.
