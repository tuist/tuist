title: Preview tracks and Tuist SDK for in-app updates
category: "Product"
---

We're introducing two new features to make managing and distributing previews even better.

## Preview tracks

You can now organize your previews into named tracks like `beta`, `nightly`, or `internal`:

```bash
tuist share App --track beta
```

Tracks make it easy to group previews by purpose and filter them in the dashboard.

## Tuist SDK

The new [Tuist SDK](https://github.com/tuist/sdk) enables your app to detect when a newer preview version is available and notify users - keeping testers on the latest build.

```swift
import TuistSDK

struct MyApp: App {
    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            ContentView()
                .task {
                    TuistSDK(
                        fullHandle: "myorg/myapp",
                        apiKey: "your-api-key"
                    )
                    .monitorPreviewUpdates()
                }
        }
    }
}
```

The SDK checks for updates within the same preview track. When you share with `--track beta`, the SDK notifies about newer builds on that track. Update checking is automatically disabled on simulators and App Store builds.

See the [Previews documentation](https://docs.tuist.dev/en/guides/features/previews) for more details.
