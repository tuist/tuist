title: Skip unit tests with tuist test
category: "Product"

We've had already had a way to easily skip UI tests with a single flag in `tuist test`:
```bash
tuist test --skip-ui-tests
```

Now, we're [bringing](https://github.com/tuist/tuist/pull/8291) the some convenience flag for unit tests:

```bash
tuist test --skip-unit-tests
```

This way, you can easily have separate CI pipelines for UI and unit tests, such as when you don't want to run your UI tests for every PR but instead nightly.
