title: Keeping source targets for binaries
category: "DevOps"
---

You can now preserve source targets when using binary caching, giving you the flexibility to debug and inspect cached dependencies when needed.

### Enable the Feature

Add this setting to your `Tuist.swift` configuration:

```swift
// Tuist.swift
import ProjectDescription

let tuist = Tuist(
  project: .tuist(
    cacheOptions: .options(
      keepSourceTargets: true
    )
  )
)
```

### What You Get

When enabled, Tuist generates:
- Your regular workspace with cached binaries for fast builds
- An additional `-Cached` scheme containing all source targets isolated from the main dependency graph

This allows you to switch between optimized binary builds and full source access without regenerating your project.

**Note:** These source targets are for inspection and debugging only. If you modify their sources, you'll need to regenerate your project to reconcile the changes with the dependency graph.
