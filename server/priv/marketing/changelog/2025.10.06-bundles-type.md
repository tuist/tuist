Tuist allows you to multiple types of bundles:
- .app
- .ipa
- .xcarchive

However, each bundle type can have a slightly different bundle size. While we recommend to primarily use the `.ipa` bundle type as the install and download size is the most accurate representation of what users will experience, the other types might be useful to recognize a spike in the bundle size early.

To streamline seeing a graph for a specific bundle type, we've added the option to filter by .ipa, .app, or .xcarchive:
