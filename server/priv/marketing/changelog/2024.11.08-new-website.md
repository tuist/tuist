This is the first changelog entry for the new website.
We've redesigned the website to reflect the new direction of Tuist,
and embody the new visual identity.

As part of this work we've also:

- Improved the accessibility of the website.
- Embraced [structured data markup](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/intro-structured-data) to enhance the search results.
- Improved the [pricing](/pricing) page to make it easier for users to understand the different plans and features.
- Added a [changelog](/changelog) page to keep users updated with the latest features and improvements.
- Consolidated the dashboard and marketing pages under [tuist.dev](https://tuist.dev) since [.io domains might disappear](https://every.to/p/the-disappearance-of-an-internet-domain)

The design of the website has been done by [Guinda Studio](https://guinda.studio) and it's publicly available.
