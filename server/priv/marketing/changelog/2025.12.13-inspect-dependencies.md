title: Unified inspect dependencies command
category: "Product"
---

We've added a new `tuist inspect dependencies` command that combines implicit and redundant dependency checks in a single invocation. This makes it ~2x faster by loading your project graph only once.

```bash
# Run both checks (default)
tuist inspect dependencies

# Run specific checks
tuist inspect dependencies --only implicit
tuist inspect dependencies --only redundant
```

The previous `tuist inspect implicit-imports` and `tuist inspect redundant-imports` commands still work but are deprecated in favor of the new unified command.
