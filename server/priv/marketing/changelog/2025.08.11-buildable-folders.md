title: Support for buildable folders in generated projects
category: "Product"
---

Apple introduced buildable folders in [Xcode 16](https://dimillian.medium.com/why-you-should-use-xcode-16-buildable-folders-instead-of-groups-6f438611914d) to reduce git conflicts in `.pbxproj` files. While we initially postponed support since these conflicts weren't frequent in our workflow, user feedback revealed another compelling benefit: buildable folders eliminate the need to regenerate projects when files are added outside of Xcode's UI—particularly valuable for automated agents and CI/CD pipelines.

Based on this feedback, we've now added support for buildable folders. If you're currently using `Target.sources` and `Target.resources`, you can migrate to the new `Target.buildableFolders` property to define buildable folders for your targets. 

Note: Xcode's synchronized groups (the underlying implementation of buildable folders) support "exceptions"—files or folders that can be excluded from synchronization. While we don't support exceptions yet, we'll add this feature based on user demand.
