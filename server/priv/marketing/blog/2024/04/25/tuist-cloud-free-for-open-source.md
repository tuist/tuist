Tuist is our comprehensive platform designed to build Xcode apps quickly and **scale them to millions of users.** Organizations can achieve [build time improvements of 70%](https://swiftheroes.com/swiftheroes-2024/talk/QN3WRR/) and more, and we are actively developing additional tools to assist organizations and platform teams in scaling up development (more details coming soon).

As a commercial open source company with open source at its core, we understand how challenging it can be to find support for your project to ensure its sustainability and continued contribution to society with common goods that benefit everyone. Therefore, **we are thrilled to announce that we are offering Tuist our paid features completely free for open source projects.**

Please note that Tuist [has basic support for Swift Packages](https://docs.tuist.io/guide/introduction/adopting-tuist/swift-package.html), allowing you to test Tuist against your existing Swift Packages to better understand the workflows and how features like binary caching can enhance your projects. It’s truly magical to experience! If your project still uses Xcode primitives such as `.xcodeproj` or `.xcworkspace`, or [another generation tool](https://docs.tuist.io/guide/introduction/adopting-tuist/migrate-from-xcodegen.html), we have put together some migration guidelines to facilitate the process. The migration is well worth it.

## How to join the program

The only requirement is to include a note in the `README.md` of the repository and send us a link to the repository along with your account handle at contact@tuist.dev. We’ll set your plan and you are good to go.

## What’s coming to Tuist

Build and test optimizations are just the beginning for Tuist. There are other challenges and areas that traditionally require organizations to invest significant time and resources, often absorbing substantial complexity themselves. We aim to alleviate this burden by providing support early in the app development lifecycle, before Xcode projects become unmanageable and unproductive. We have many ideas for future enhancements, but we’ll save those for a future blog post.
