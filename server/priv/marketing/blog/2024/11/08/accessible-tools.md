As we keep pushing to give Apple’s official tools new superpowers and fill the gaps in the developer experience, it’s clear just how essential it is for Tuist to be accessible to every developer and organization. What does that mean?

First, we need to meet developers where they are. If you prefer using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) to install Tuist, we'll make it an official installation method. If you work with [Fastlane](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane), there will be a lane that seamlessly integrates Tuist. And most importantly, if you’re working on an Xcode project and want to introduce Tuist without overhauling your workflow, we’ll make that easy for you, too.

Accessibility also means breaking down language barriers. In many parts of the world, language can be a hurdle, and we don’t want that to stand between developers and Tuist. We’re [committed to creating resources in multiple languages](https://community.tuist.io/t/our-documentation-is-now-localizable/94), fostering local communities, and helping developers everywhere learn how to scale Swift app development with Tuist. **Communities have brought us this far, and we’re dedicated to giving back and nurturing these connections.**

## Pricing that’s accessible: open, fair, and transparent

But accessibility goes beyond tools and language. Pricing plays a crucial role, and it’s something we need to address today. All around us, we see a trend of closed, one-on-one negotiated pricing models, restrictive demo versions, and opaque pricing tactics that sales reps often leverage through fear. We believe this inaccessibility is detrimental, and we want to be part of changing that norm.

Everyone should have access to tools that enable faster, better app development, no matter their background or financial situation. **If you're an indie developer just starting out, you shouldn’t have to pay for features that could significantly improve your daily work and app quality.** It’s as simple as that. If we truly want to impact the ecosystem, we must ensure that everyone in it can access the tools that make this possible. We’re not a traditional sales-driven company—we’re here to empower, not exploit.

Our business model is straightforward:
- Through usage measurement, payments reflect the value derived from the tool.
- Thanks to large enterprises, we can afford to keep costs low or even free for indie developers and small startups.
- We’re committed to open-sourcing more, driving innovation, and enabling use cases we can’t even imagine today.

## Join us in reversing this trend

If you share our mission of promoting accessible and sustainable tools in the Apple ecosystem, we’d love to collaborate with you.

If you're an organization or developer paying a hefty price for a valuable service with a pricing model you find unfair, or if there’s a tool you wish you could add to your setup without going through sales hurdles, let us know at [contact@tuist.dev](mailto:contact@tuist.dev).

**Our team will work with you to develop the feature, and in return, you’ll get lifetime access to it—yes, free forever, as long as there are no high underlying costs of infrastructure.** Together, we’ll build something that’s more accessible for the entire ecosystem, and you’ll benefit from it at no cost.

Where possible, we’ll aim to make the client-side code open source, creating a commodity for the community, while the server side enhances the tool and sustains Tuist. You win, we win, and the ecosystem wins.

Deal? Let’s make the Apple ecosystem a more accessible, inclusive place for everyone.
