As you would all guess, Tuist’s main way of communicating is through the website. It’s where developers begin exploring the product, learning about its features, and discovering what Tuist is all about. We wanted to make this experience simple and welcoming, not just visually, but also in how the brand and content feel.

As the product evolved, the old website no longer represented what we’re building and shipping today. After redesigning our developer dashboard, we wanted our landing page to match its new look and feel. We began by reviewing what worked well on the previous site and what could be improved, drawing inspiration from other developer tools. We also realized some important information was missing, and with new features launching every cycle, it felt like the perfect time for a redesign.

## The process

Before redesigning the website, we spent time researching what could be improved and what was missing. We reviewed over 25 developer tool websites, studying their strengths and weaknesses. The website plays a big role in shaping our brand identity, and with the dashboard redesign, we wanted to bring the same look and feel to our site.

The main issues we identified were:
* The messaging wasn’t clear, while we started as a CLI-only tool, we now have a dashboard with new features launching frequently.
* The visuals weren’t self-explanatory.
* The website’s structure and navigation was a bit confusing and lacked clarity.

In our previous website design, showcasing Tuist’s features and keeping the page updated was challenging. To solve this, we introduced bento card designs with custom illustrations to present each feature more clearly and visually.

Customer case studies are a key part of our storytelling, so we decided to include custom illustrations that reflect each customer’s experience, showing how Tuist helped them reduce build times and collaborate smoothly without disrupting their existing developer flow.

As an open-source company, we also wanted to highlight key metrics that could inspire more developers to join and contribute to the project.

With this new website, we believe we can communicate our message to developers in a clearer and more visually engaging way. While our main goal was to strengthen the message we wanted to show, we also took the opportunity to refine our visual language. 

## What’s next

We’ll keep improving our homepage, adding micro-interactions to make it feel more dynamic and engaging. We also plan to introduce dedicated feature pages to explain each of Tuist’s capabilities in depth. And who knows, maybe a dark mode is on the way…

Redesigning and redefining Tuist’s message was an incredibly fun and rewarding process.
