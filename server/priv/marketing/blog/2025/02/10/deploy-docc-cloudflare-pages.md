If you need to deploy and host a [DocC documentation](https://www.swift.org/documentation/docc/), the go-to solution for documenting your Swift packages, on [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/), this guide has you covered. Cloudflare Pages is a great alternative to GitHub Pages, especially if you want your documentation to live under a custom domain that you might already have on Cloudflare for that extra bit of polish âœ¨

**Note:** We're assuming that you have a Cloudflare account set up. The examples will be using GitHub Actions, but you can adapt them to any CI/CD system you prefer.

## Build your DocC documentation

We'll first need to build the DocC documentation. The easiest way is to add the [DocC plugin](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-docc-plugin) to your `Package.swift`:
```swift
let package = Package(
    // name, platforms, products, etc.
    dependencies: [
        // other dependencies
        .package(url: "https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-docc-plugin", from: "1.1.0"),
    ],
    targets: [
        // targets
    ]
)
```

You can check the documentation builds by running `swift package generate-documentation`. To make our lives easier on the CI, we'll generate the documentation into a specific directory and transform it for static hosting:
```bash
swift package --allow-writing-to-directory .build/documentation generate-documentation --disable-indexing --output-path .build/documentation --transform-for-static-hosting --target YourProduct
```

If you have multiple targets you want to generate the documentation for, we can leverage the new [`--enable-experimental-combined-documentation` flag](https://forums.swift.org/t/a-preview-of-doccs-support-for-combined-documentation/74373) to generate a single documentation for all targets:
```bash
swift package --allow-writing-to-directory .build/documentation generate-documentation --disable-indexing --output-path .build/documentation --transform-for-static-hosting --enable-experimental-combined-documentation --target YourProductA --target YourProductB
``` 
With this new flag, each target will have its own section in the documentation. In Swift 6.1, this flag will even create an index page:

![Conmbined documentation](/marketing/images/blog/2025/02/10/deploy-docc-cloudflare-pages/combined-documentation.png)

We are very excited about this development as it will make it even easier to host documentation for packages with multiple products, which is quite common.

## Set up Cloudflare pages

Let's first set up Cloudflare Pages by going to the `Workers & Pages` page and creating a new project. Once you have connected your GitHub account, you can import a repository that contains your DocC documentation:

![Create Workers & Pages](/marketing/images/blog/2025/02/10/deploy-docc-cloudflare-pages/workers-pages-create.png)

You can also follow the official [Cloudflare documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/framework-guides/deploy-anything/). Note that since we will be deploying the documentation from GitHub Actions, we'll want to disable automatic deployment in the settings of the Cloudflare Pages project.

## GitHub Actions pipeline

Now to the more interesting part. We will need a GitHub Actions pipeline that will build and deploy the DocC documentation to Cloudflare Pages. For this, we'll be using Cloudflare's [Wrangler Action](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler-action). To deploy from GitHub Actions, we will need to grab a Cloudflare API token. If you don't have a Cloudflare API token, you can grab one by following [these steps](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/ci-cd/external-cicd/github-actions/#api-token). This token should be set as a `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` in your GitHub repository's secrets.

We'll use a [Cloudflare example](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler-action?tab=readme-ov-file#deploy-when-commits-are-merged-to-main) as a base to build out our pipeline:
```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Deploy
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Deploy
        uses: cloudflare/wrangler-action@v3
        with:
          apiToken: ${{ secrets.CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN }}
```

This pipeline will deploy the documentation to Cloudflare Pages every time you push to the `main` branch. You can adjust the `branches` field to match your repository's branch naming convention. However, we still need to build the documentation. If your package is buildable on Linux, we can keep the `ubuntu-latest` machine and we'll need to set up Swift:
```yaml
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Deploy
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Deploy
      - name: Setup Swift
        uses: SwiftyLab/setup-swift@latest
```

If your package builds on macOS only, you can switch `ubuntu-latest` to `macos-latest` and remove the `Setup Swift` step.

Before deploying, we'll reuse the step from the previous section to build the documentation and we'll update the deploy step to use the DocC artifacts:
```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  publish:
    runs-on: macos-latest
    name: Publish to Cloudflare Pages
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Build docs
        run: |
          swift package --allow-writing-to-directory .build/documentation generate-documentation --disable-indexing --output-path .build/documentation --transform-for-static-hosting --enable-experimental-combined-documentation --target YourProductA --target YourProductB
      - name: Deploy
        uses: cloudflare/wrangler-action@v3
        with:
          apiToken: ${{ secrets.CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN }}
          # name-of-your-project is by default the name of the repository
          command: pages deploy .build/documentation --project-name=name-of-your-project
```

...and that's it ðŸŽ‰ Your DocC documentation will now be automatically built and deployed to Cloudflare Pages every time you push to the `main` branch. You can now enjoy your beautifully hosted documentation under your custom domain hosted on Cloudflare Pages.
