Tuist's approach to building technology has always been driven by being community-first. Tuist is what it is today thanks to our wonderful and talented community—people who show up and contribute, whether through issues, pull requests, or conference talks.

Among these contributors, some individuals have gone above and beyond. For a long time, we've felt a deep sense of gratitude toward them. Inspired by other community-driven projects like Dagger, we [announced](https://community.tuist.dev/t/announcing-the-tuist-ambassadors-program/157) the Tuist Ambassadors Program in October 2024.

Today, I am honored to introduce you to our first Tuist ambassadors. But before we highlight them, let me share more details about the program.

## The Program

Ambassadors are individuals passionate about Tuist and its mission. They are selected based on their contributions to the project and their ability to represent Tuist within the community. In recognition of their efforts, Tuist will publicly acknowledge their contributions and support their professional growth. Additionally, ambassadors will receive exclusive swag and assistance when attending events.

As we shape the direction of the project, we will collaborate closely with ambassadors to ensure alignment with our vision and goals. The role lasts for one year to allow for rotation, and we continuously welcome new ambassadors when we recognize outstanding contributions.

## Meet the Ambassadors

### Andy Kolean

[Andy](https://github.com/ajkolean) first engaged with Tuist by suggesting an enhancement to our graph command in [this topic](https://community.tuist.dev/t/enhancing-tuists-graph-command-with-interactive-graph/225). He then followed up with an [amazing contribution](https://github.com/tuist/XcodeGraph/pull/87) that introduced a solution to map Xcode projects and workspaces to Tuist’s internal models, specifically through [XcodeGraph](https://github.com/tuist/xcodegraph).

By bridging these domains, Andy’s work not only advances our mission to meet developers where they are but also enables a more high-level interaction with Xcode projects and workspaces. His contributions have had a profound impact on Tuist’s evolution.

### Łukasz Lech

[Łukasz](https://github.com/leszko11) has been making top-notch contributions to Tuist since 2020, from his home in the beautiful city of Wrocław, Poland. A strong advocate for Tuist, he has consistently highlighted its value in making Xcode projects and workspaces more manageable. He actively promotes Tuist at every opportunity, including at the [Swift Heroes](https://swiftheroes.com/swiftheroes-2024/speaker/AK9KM9/) conference in 2024.

### Loyle (Sang Hyeok Kim)

Tuist has gained significant popularity in South Korea, in large part thanks to dedicated contributors like [Loyle](https://github.com/sanghyeok-kim). He not only delivers exceptional contributions but also plays a crucial advocacy role, spreading the word about Tuist within the Korean developer community.

### Anıl Taşkıran

[Anıl](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aniltaskiran/) has been a long-time supporter of Tuist, especially in the Turkish community. He works at Trendyol, one of the largest e-commerce companies in Turkey, where he has been instrumental in introducing Tuist to his colleagues. Trendyol has been using Tuist for multiple years now and has been [vocal about its benefits](https://tuist.dev/blog/2024/12/16/trendyol).

## Closing Words

I couldn't be more proud of our ambassadors and the impact they have on the Tuist community. Over the coming months, we will continue working on new community initiatives to foster collaboration and innovation—key elements in building the most useful productivity tool for app developers.

Thank you to all our contributors, and a special congratulations to our first Tuist ambassadors!
