At Tuist, we are deeply committed to ensuring the security of our tools and services. We understand that trust is fundamental, especially when it comes to tools that developers rely on to build high-quality software. This page outlines our security practices, how to report vulnerabilities, and the steps we take to safeguard our users and their projects.

## Certifications

Tuist is SOC 2 Type II certified, which means we have undergone a rigorous audit to ensure our security controls meet industry standards. You can check our [trust center](https://security.tuist.dev/) for more information and obtain our most recent SOC 2 Type II report.

## Security Practices

### Infrastructure security
Tuist operates on secure cloud infrastructure designed to ensure high availability and protection against threats. Our infrastructure security measures include:
- **Encryption**: Data in transit is encrypted using HTTPS/TLS, and sensitive data at rest is secured with strong encryption methods.
- **Access Management**: We use role-based access control (RBAC) and enforce the principle of least privilege across our systems.
- **Regular Audits**: Security configurations and processes undergo periodic reviews to identify and address potential weaknesses.

### Application security
- **Secure Software Development**: Tuist follows a rigorous software development lifecycle that incorporates security best practices such as static analysis, peer code reviews, and automated testing.
- **Dependency Management**: Dependencies are actively monitored, and critical updates are applied promptly to mitigate risks from third-party vulnerabilities.
- **Continuous Monitoring**: We deploy monitoring tools to detect and respond to potential security incidents in real time.

### Incident response
Tuist has a robust incident response process to handle security incidents efficiently. Our process includes identifying the issue, mitigating risks, and communicating with affected users transparently.

### Data protection
- **Data Minimization**: We only collect the data necessary to provide our services.
- **Retention Policies**: Data is retained only for as long as needed and securely deleted afterward.
- **Privacy by Design**: Our tools are built with user privacy in mind from the ground up.

## Reporting vulnerabilities
If you discover a security vulnerability, we encourage you to report it to us responsibly. Hereâ€™s how to proceed:

1. **Email**: Contact us at [contact@tuist.dev](mailto:contact@tuist.dev).
2. **Details**: Provide a detailed description of the issue, including reproduction steps, screenshots, and relevant logs if applicable.

We prioritize all security reports and work diligently to address them. Public acknowledgment is available for those who help secure Tuist, upon request.

## Responsible disclosure policy
We ask security researchers to:
- Allow Tuist a reasonable timeframe to investigate and resolve the issue before disclosing it publicly.
- Avoid actions that could compromise user data or disrupt services.

## Bug bounty program
Tuist is working on introducing a bug bounty program to reward security researchers for identifying vulnerabilities. Stay tuned for updates on this initiative.

## Future enhancements
Security is an ongoing priority at Tuist. We are committed to improving our security posture through:
- Enhancing threat detection and response capabilities.
- Expanding our bug bounty program to encourage broader participation.
