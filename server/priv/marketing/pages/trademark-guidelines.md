# Trademark Guidelines

_Last updated July 25th, 2024_

Below is our trademark policy inspired by [Dagger's](https://dagger.io/trademark-guidelines). We want to make our policy easily accessible, so we have created some FAQs to help steer you in the right direction.

Please take a moment to read the policy in its entirety.

If you have any questions or doubts about your project using our trademark, please contact us at legal@tuist.io. We are happy to help provide more guidance for your use case.

## Trademark FAQs

### I have a repo on GitHub that is related to Tuist. Can I have Tuist in the name?

Yes, as follows. To avoid confusion in the community, your repo must clearly show that it is not directly related to Tuist. We ask that you use the following naming convention: `[YourProjectName]-for-Tuist`.

### I am a package manager. Am I allowed to package and distribute Tuist? Am I allowed to create my own package named Tuist?

- **Tuist** is a registered trademark, including all casings such as "tuist" or "TUIST."
- You are not permitted to build from the source code and produce a package with a name that contains "Tuist" without express written permission.
- Packaging separate components, such as the Tuist XcodeProj, under the name "Tuist" is not allowed.
- You may distribute and refer to the unaltered binaries obtained directly from Tuist as "tuist" (lowercase) provided that the version and platform (OS and architecture) are correct and checksums are verified.
- Installers may download unaltered binaries directly from Tuist, as long as checksums are verified.

If you are packaging other software related to Tuist and want to include "Tuist" in the name, then follow the GitHub repo naming convention outlined above.

### If I fork the Tuist repo, can I continue to call it Tuist?

Sometimes. If you modify Tuist code for purposes other than bug fixes followed by pull requests to Tuist, you must rename the repository to avoid confusion. If the fork creates a commercially competitive solution or introduces security vulnerabilities, you may be required to change the repository name.

### Can you give me some ideas of an acceptable name for a Tuist-related repo?

We suggest following this naming convention: `[YourProjectName]-for-Tuist`. If you want to use a different naming convention, please refer to the "use to indicate compatibility" section of our trademark policy. Contact legal@tuist.io for guidance.
