3.2. Switching shall be treated as a Service under the Agreement.

## 4. Switching Request, Procedure

4.1. The Customer initiates the Switching by sending Tuist notice of its intent to switch in the form of a Valid Request, in accordance with this Clause 4 and as indicated in Clause 11. The Notice Period will commence when Tuist receives a Valid Request. If the Customer wishes to switch only with regard to certain Products and Services and the corresponding Data or Digital Assets, this must be specified in the Valid Request. The Customer may give notice by using the form in Appendix 3.

4.2. Customer shall specify in the Valid Request the relevant Data Processing Service and whether the Customer intends:

(a) to switch to a Destination Provider of the Same Service Type. In this case the Customer shall provide necessary details of the Destination Provider and the services offered by the Destination Provider;

(b) to switch to Customer's on-premises ICT infrastructure;

(c) erase their Exportable Data and give notice by using the form in Appendix 4.

4.3. In addition to the information set out above, a Valid Request must include all other details necessary for Tuist to enable the Switching or the erasing of Exportable Data, including, as applicable, details about the Destination Provider, the destination ICT infrastructure, the envisaged timing and the Customer representative(s) responsible for the process. Determination of whether a specific service qualifies as the Same Service Type shall be made by Tuist in good faith, taking into account the primary purpose, essential features of the services as described in the Valid Request by the Customer. In the scenario contemplated by Clause 4.5, below, a Valid Request will also include the proof of authorization.

4.4. Tuist confirms to the Customer the receipt of the switching notice using the same way of communication as the one used by the Customer. If the request received does not contain the information required to constitute a Valid Request, Tuist will promptly inform the Customer of which information is missing and Customer may resubmit the request with the missing information.

4.5. A request for Switching may also be submitted by a third party authorized by the Customer, in which case the request must include proof of the Customer authorization to the third party.

4.6. Tuist and the Customer shall, and the Customer shall ensure that any Destination Provider involved in the Switching will, cooperate in good faith to make the Switching effective, enable the timely transfer of data and maintain the continuity of the Data Processing Services concerned.

## 5. Transitional Period

5.1. The Transitional Period shall be thirty (30) days or such other time as agreed by the Parties in writing.

5.2. If Tuist determines that it will not be technically feasible to complete the Switching within the agreed Transition Period, Tuist shall:

(a) notify the Customer within 14 Working Days after receiving the Valid Request;

(b) indicate an alternative Transitional Period, which must not exceed seven (7) months from the date of the Customer's Valid Request; and

(c) explain why adhering to the Transition Period is not technically feasible.

5.3. The Customer shall confirm the receipt of the notice for alternative Transitional Period within three (3) Working Days. Failure to confirm receipt will be treated as acceptance of the alternative proposal.

5.4. The Customer may extend the Transitional Period once, for a period but in no case for any period longer than three (3) months ("Alternative Transition Period"). Customer shall notify Tuist of the change before the end of the original Transitional Period and indicates the Alternative Transitional Period. The Customer shall use the form set out in Appendix 5 to provide notice of its request for an Alternative Transition Period.

## 6. Obligations of Tuist during the Switching

Tuist shall provide reasonable assistance to the Customer and third parties authorized by the Customer to assist with the Switching once the Switching process starts and throughout its duration. To this effect, Tuist shall:

(a) act with due care to maintain business continuity and continue to provide the functions or Data Processing Service(s) under the Agreement;

(b) maintain a high level of security throughout the Switching, in particular for the security of the Data during their transfer, consistent with the level of security provided in accordance with the terms of this Agreement; and

(c) if problems are detected during the switching and cannot be resolved through technical support, together with the Customer, analyse the causes and agree on the solutions.

## 7. Obligations of the Customer during the Switching

7.1. The Customer undertakes to take all reasonable measures to achieve effective Switching. The Customer undertakes to be responsible for the import and implementation of Data and Digital Assets in their ICT infrastructure or in the systems of the Destination Provider, including where the Customer uses the Data Processing Services of a third party for these actions.

7.2. Customer shall notify Tuist of the successful Switching promptly and without undue delay. Any costs associated with Customer's delay shall be borne by the Customer.

7.3.

The Customer undertakes to provide access to, and enable the use of these materials by third parties mandated by them only insofar as this is absolutely necessary to complete the Switching and only upon Tuist's explicit authorization and provided that such third parties are bound by appropriate contractual confidentiality obligations. The access to and use of Tuist's materials related to the Switching which are protected by intellectual property rights and/or trade secrets related to the Switching will be terminated no later than at the end of the agreed Transitional Period, including the Alternative Transitional Period, in full compliance with the confidentiality commitments and the intellectual property rights granted by Tuist. In all other aspects, the Customer's confidentiality obligations as provided by the Agreement shall remain unchanged by this Addendum.

7.4. The Customer shall act in good faith to implement any instructions related to the Switching given by Tuist. The reasonable measures to achieve effective switching on the part of the Customer include, in particular:

If a third party is entrusted with switching, providing appropriate instructions to such third party so that it respects the Agreement between the Customer and Tuist).

(b) Monitoring the switching process (e.g. check the exported Data and Digital Assets during the switching to immediately identify any problems).

(c) Appropriate contractual arrangements with the Destination Provider or ensuring appropriate resources for on-premises switching.

8.2. At the end of Data Retrieval Period, and if the Switching has been successfully completed, Tuist shall erase all Exportable Data generated by the Customer or directly related to the Customer.

## 9. Switching Charges and Early Termination Fees

9.1. For each Valid Request made before 12 January 2027, Tuist may charge Customer for switching services provided by Tuist or a third party, as described in the Plan and based on the list of Switching charges provided to Customer before the Effective Date of the Agreement or by 12 September 2025 (whichever is later), or, absent such list, based on the hourly rate of net EUR 200 (excl. applicable taxes) and the time directly spent on the Switching concerned (rounded up or down to the next full hour, as applicable).

9.2. If a Valid Request results in the termination of the Agreement pursuant to Clause 10 prior to the agreed fixed term of the Agreement, Tuist may invoice Customer for an amount equal to the Fees that would have been due or payable by Customer if the Agreement had not been terminated before the end of its term, minus any costs directly attributable to the performance of the Agreement that Tuist would have incurred by the end of that term but will not incur due to the early termination ("**Early Termination Charges**"). The Early Termination Charges shall become due and payable in accordance with the payment terms of the Agreement.

## 10. Termination

Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in the Agreement, and without limitation to the termination rights set out in the Agreement, the Agreement will be considered terminated between the Parties on the date that one of the following events occurs:

(a) Where applicable, upon the successful completion of the Switching. If the successful completion of the Switching occurs before the expiry of the agreed duration of the Agreement, then the Early Termination Fees set out in Clause 9.2 will become due; or

(b) At the end of the Notice Period, if the Customer has requested the erasure of its Exportable Data, upon termination of the Data Processing Service, unless otherwise agreed by the Parties.

## 11. Notices

The Parties agree any notification between them in respect of switching and exit to be done as agreed in the Agreement.

## 12. Order of Precedence

In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between these clauses on switching and exit and any other applicable contractual arrangements, terms, conditions or other applicable Agreements related to switching between Data Processing Services, these clauses will take precedence.
