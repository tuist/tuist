### Software Made for Eternity

**Tuist was built for the future of Xcode development.** We believe that code is abundant and should be owned by both everyone and no one.

Tuist GmbH, a technology startup from Berlin (Jessnerstrasse 27A 10247), is the sole owner of the Tuist trademark and provides core contributors for Tuist. Tuist itself is MIT-Licensed, and its server is FCL-1.0-MIT-licensend.

With many active contributors, hundreds of companies using Tuist, a sponsorship program, and a growing community, we are confident that Tuist will be around for a long time.

However, in the unlikely event that Tuist GmbH discontinues support for the Tuist repositories, we will re-license the Tuist server with a permissive license and transfer ownership of the repositories to the top contributors at that time.

As long as Xcode projects exist, developers will continue to create exciting projects and prosper. 

We’ll make sure they can build them, forever.
