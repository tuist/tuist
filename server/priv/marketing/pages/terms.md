7.1.1. The Fees and any other charges incurred, such as taxes and transaction fees, will be charged to Your payment method on the specific payment date indicated on Your 'Account' page. The billing cycle length depends on the subscription plan chosen at sign up, as detailed on our pricing page at [https://tuist.dev/pricing](https://tuist.dev/pricing). Payment dates may change if Your payment method fails, You change Your subscription plan, or if Your subscription began on a day not contained in a given month. You can view Your current month's usage and see Your next payment date by visiting the dashboard and clicking on the 'Billing Details' link on the 'Account' page. We may authorize Your payment method in anticipation of subscription charges through various methods, including authorizing it for up to approximately one month of service upon registration.

7.1.2. To use the Services, You must provide one or more payment methods. You authorize us to charge any payment method associated with Your account if Your primary payment method is declined or unavailable. You remain responsible for any uncollected amounts. If a payment is not successfully settled due to expiration, insufficient funds, or otherwise, and You do not cancel Your account, we may suspend Your access to the Platform and our Services until we successfully charge a valid payment method. For some payment methods, the issuer may charge fees, such as foreign transaction fees. Local tax charges may vary depending on the payment method used. Check with Your payment method service provider for details.

7.1.3. If the payment method credit card via Stripe is selected, the invoice amount is due immediately upon conclusion of the Agreement. Payment is processed by the payment service provider, Stripe Payments Europe Ltd., 1 Grand Canal Street Lower, Grand Canal Dock, Dublin, Ireland (hereinafter, "**Stripe**"). Stripe reserves the right to carry out a credit check and to reject this payment method if the credit check is negative.

7.1.4. You can update Your payment method by visiting the 'Account' page. We may also update Your payment methods using information provided by payment service providers. Following any update, You authorize us to continue charging the applicable payment method.

7.1.5. You can cancel Your subscription at any time, and You will continue to have access through the end of Your billing period. Payments are nonrefundable, and we do not provide refunds or credits for partial periods. To cancel, go to the 'Account' page and follow the cancellation instructions. If You cancel, Your account will close at the end of Your current billing period.

7.1.6. We may change our subscription plans and prices from time to time. We will notify You at least one (1) month before any changes take effect. If You do not wish to accept the changes, You can cancel Your subscription before they become effective or reject acceptance. If You do not accept such change within the given acceptance period, we may terminate the subscription at the end of the then-current billing period.

7.1.7. Fees stated are net amounts exclusive of any Taxes and such Taxes shall be borne by You. If Tuist is responsible for paying any Taxes in respect of any Fees pursuant to Applicable Law, the corresponding amounts shall be added to the applicable invoice issued by Tuist and paid by You together with the relevant Fees.

7.1.8. For customers that reside outside of Germany, any amount payable shall be paid without deduction, withholding, or other consideration of any Withholding Tax, unless such deduction, withholding, or other consideration is required by law. If You are required by law to withhold and pay Withholding Tax on any amount payable to Tuist, You shall make all payments required in connection with such withholding in a timely manner and in the minimum amount required by law and/or administrative regulation, file with the taxing authorities, document, and provide Tuist with evidence of such withholding by submitting the original tax receipt. In this case, the remuneration to be paid by the Customer shall be increased by an amount necessary for Tuist receiving a net amount equal to the amount it would have received if the tax deduction had not been made. You and Tuist will take reasonable steps to obtain a refund of the Withholding Tax from the applicable taxing authority. If Tuist ultimately receives a tax refund claim or tax credit, Tuist will refund to You an amount that Tuist calculates to be equal to the tax refund or tax credit received. You shall indemnify Tuist against all costs and expenses incurred as a result of applying for a refund of the Withholding Tax. Any claims by You under this Section 7.1 shall become time-barred six (6) months from the end of term during which the relevant Withholding Tax can be assessed or its assessment can be altered pursuant to Applicable Law.

7.2. If Tuist does not receive Fees by the due date, then at Tuist's discretion, without limiting Tuist's other rights and remedies, such charges may accrue late interest, calculated in accordance with Applicable Law (plus the costs of collection).

7.3. If You do not pay any overdue amounts owed by You for the Platform within five (5) days from having received notice from Tuist of such overdue amounts, Tuist may, without limiting Tuist's other rights and remedies, suspend Your (including, for clarity, its Users') access to the Platform until such amounts are paid in full.

7.4. You may offset Tuist's remuneration claims under this Agreement only against claims that have been legally established by final judgment or accepted by Tuist.

## Section 9: Warranties

9.1. The parties represent and warrant to each other that (i) each party is duly organized, validly existing, and in good standing as a corporation or other entity under Applicable Law of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or other organization; (ii) each party has the full right, power, and authority to enter into and perform the obligations and grant the rights, licenses, consents, and authorizations it grants or is required to grant under this Agreement; and (iii) the execution of this Agreement by its representative has been duly authorized by all necessary corporate or organizational action of such party.

9.2. Tuist's sole representations and warranties in respect of the Platform are as follows: (i) the Platform as delivered by Tuist does not infringe third-party intellectual property rights and is free from third-party rights that would prevent the use of the Software in accordance with the Agreement; and (ii) the Platform as delivered by Tuist complies with the specifications set forth in the Documentation and operates substantially in accordance with the Documentation.

9.3. You represent and warrant to Tuist that (i) You own or otherwise have and will have necessary and sufficient rights and consents in and relating to Your Customer Data as received by Tuist; (ii) Your Customer Data does not and will not infringe, misappropriate, or otherwise violate any Intellectual Property Rights, or any privacy or other rights of any third party or violate any Applicable Laws; and (iii) Your use of the Platform and all Customer Data is and will be at all times compliant with Your privacy policies and Applicable Laws.

9.4. In the event of a breach of a Tuist warranty regarding the Software, the procedure set forth in the SLA shall apply. In the event of any other breaches of warranty with respect to the Software, You shall promptly inform Tuist in reasonable detail and give Tuist reasonable opportunity to correct the nonconformity or to re-perform the relevant service at no additional charge to You. Only if correction or re-performance fails, You may terminate the subscription and receive a refund of any Fees You have prepaid with respect to the affected work or service. For the avoidance of doubt, You shall not be entitled to any refund of Fees to the extent they relate to unaffected work or services actually received by You. Correction or reperformance are deemed failed if (a) correction or re-performance is impossible, (b) correction or re-performance cannot reasonably be expected to succeed, (c) Tuist refuses or unreasonably delays correction or re-performance, (d) Tuist had sufficient opportunity to correct the nonconformity or properly re-perform the service but failed to do so within reasonable time, or (e) You cannot reasonably be expected to accept correction or re-performance under the specific circumstances taking into account both Parties' legitimate interests. You shall not be entitled to any warranty claims (a) to the extent the relevant error or other nonconformance was caused by misuse, unauthorized modifications, or third-party hardware, software, or services, (b) the relevant work or service was provided on a no-charge or evaluation basis, or (c) You culpably failed to notify Tuist of the error or other nonconformance within one (1) week from the error or other nonconformance becoming apparent to You.

9.5. If and to the extent that the Software infringes any third-party right, Tuist may, at its option (i) secure sufficient licenses or other rights to use the relevant third-party right; or (ii) remedy the enforcement of any claims based on the relevant third-party right against You in accordance with Section 10; or (iii) change or replace the Software in such a manner that it no longer infringes the relevant third-party right while substantially maintaining the warranted functionality of the Software.

9.6. Your right of termination for failure to provide the use of the Platform pursuant to Section 543 (2) sentence 1 no. 1 German Civil Code (BGB) shall be excluded unless the provision of the contractual use of the Platform is deemed to have failed.

9.7. Any claims for damages due to any breach of warranty and claims for compensation of wasted efforts due to defects are subject to Section 11. Together with Section 10 (Intellectual Property Indemnification) and Section 11 (Liability), this Section 9 sets out Your sole remedies for any breach of warranty.

## Section 10: Intellectual Property Indemnification

10.1. If a third party asserts claims against You and your employees, officers, and directors which are based on the infringement of any third party's intellectual property rights through the use of the Platform, and if Tuist is obliged to remedy such defect of title within the scope of its warranty obligations, Tuist shall also defend You against the claims of the third party as follows and shall indemnify You against these claims within the scope of the agreed limitation of liability in Section 11. Intellectual property rights in this sense are only those to which the third party is entitled in the Federal Republic of Germany.

10.2. The foregoing indemnification obligation shall not apply to the extent the infringement claim arises as a result of (i) the combination of the Platform with other non-Tuist products or software not specifically permitted in the Documentation, and (ii) unauthorized use of the Platform or use of the Platform in breach of the Agreement by the Customer.

10.3. You will defend Tuist and its affiliates, and their respective employees, officers, and directors against any third-party claim alleging that Your Customer Data infringes or misappropriates that third party's intellectual property rights.

10.4. The Party responsible for the infringement shall undertake the legal defense against such third-party claims at its own expense. The responsible Party shall reimburse the other Party only for expenses incurred as a result of a final judgment.

10.5. The foregoing indemnity obligations are conditioned upon the indemnified Party providing to the indemnifying Party (i) prompt written notice of the assertion of any claim by the third party (but in any event notice given in sufficient time for the indemnifying Party to respond without prejudice), (ii) the right to control and direct the investigation, defense, and any settlement of such claim; to the extent that the indemnified Party is unable to fully transfer the legal defense to the indemnifying Party, the indemnifying Party shall instead grant control over the legal defense and shall only and at all times act in agreement with the indemnified Party in the context of the legal defense or in settlement negotiations, and (iii) all reasonable and necessary cooperation.

10.6. Neither Party shall agree to any settlement that admits fault or attributes liability or otherwise imposes any affirmative obligation on the other Party without first obtaining prior consent from the other Party.

10.7. The limitation period for the claim for indemnification corresponds to the limitation period for Your warranty claims for defects in title.

## Section 11: Liability

11.1. Tuist will be liable in accordance with the applicable law: (i) for willfulness and gross negligence; (ii) for damage to life, limb, or health; (iii) for breach of a specific guarantee; (iv) for fraudulent misrepresentation and fraudulent concealment of a defect; and (v) in accordance with the German Product Liability Act (Produkthaftungsgesetz).

11.2. Tuist will also be liable in the event of a breach of an essential obligation under the Agreement due to ordinary negligence on the part of Tuist or any of its representatives, or vicarious or surrogate agents, but limited to the foreseeable, typical damage. Essential obligations are obligations that necessarily need to be fulfilled to enable performance of the Agreement and on which You regularly rely and may reasonably rely.

11.3. Except as set forth in Sections 11.1 and 11.2, Tuist's liability is hereby excluded.

11.4. The exclusions and limitations of liability set forth in this Section 11 (Liability) equally apply to Tuist's legal representatives, or vicarious and surrogate agents.

11.5. Liability in accordance with Section 11.4 is limited to EUR 50.00 if Services are provided by Tuist to You free of charge.

## Section 12: Confidentiality

12.1. Each Party acknowledges that during the performance of the Agreement, it may obtain the Confidential Information of the other Party. The Receiving Party shall, both during the term of the Agreement and a period of five (5) years thereafter, keep in confidence and trust all of the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information received by it, and the Receiving Party shall not use the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party other than as necessary to fulfill the Receiving Party's obligations or to exercise the Receiving Party's rights under the Agreement. Each Party agrees to secure and protect the other Party's Confidential Information with the same degree of care and in a manner consistent with the maintenance of such Party's own Confidential Information (but in no event less than reasonable care), and to take appropriate action by instruction or agreement with its employees or other agents who are permitted access to the other Party's Confidential Information to satisfy its obligations under this Section. The Receiving Party shall not disclose Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party to any person or entity other than its officers, employees, and agents who need to know it to exercise the Receiving Party's rights and fulfill its obligations under the Agreement, and who are subject to confidentiality obligations at least as stringent as the obligations set forth in the Agreement. The Receiving Party shall be liable for any breach of this Section 12.1 by such persons.

12.2. The obligations set forth in Section 12.1 shall not apply to information that the Receiving Party can document: (i) was known by the Receiving Party prior to receipt from the Disclosing Party, either by obtaining the information itself or through receipt directly or indirectly from a source other than one having an obligation of confidentiality to the Disclosing Party; (ii) was independently developed by the Receiving Party without use of or reference to the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information; or (iii) becomes publicly known or otherwise ceases to be secret or confidential, except as a result of a breach of the Agreement or any obligation of confidentiality by the Receiving Party.

12.3. Nothing in the Agreement shall prevent the Receiving Party from disclosing Confidential Information to the extent the Receiving Party is legally compelled to do so by (i) any governmental investigative or judicial agency pursuant to proceedings over which such agency has jurisdiction or (ii) Applicable Law; provided, however, that prior to any such disclosure, the Receiving Party shall (x) assert the confidential nature of the Confidential Information to the relevant authority and disclose only so much Confidential Information as is required; (y) immediately notify the Disclosing Party in writing of the request for disclosure and provide the Disclosing Party with sufficient opportunity to challenge the request; and (z) cooperate fully with the Disclosing Party in protecting against any such disclosure and in obtaining a protective order narrowing the scope of the compelled disclosure and protecting its confidentiality.

## Section 13: Term and Termination

13.1. This Agreement commences on the date You signed up for the Services online and continues until terminated pursuant to Section 13.2. Each individual subscription shall continue for the Term.

13.2. Each Party can terminate this Agreement with effect from the end of the next billing period.

13.3. Either Party may terminate the Agreement by notice to the other Party for cause:

(a) if the other Party is in material breach of this Agreement and either the breach cannot be cured or, if the breach can be cured, it is not cured within thirty (30) days following that Party's receipt of notice of such breach. The Parties agree that any breach of Section 4, Section 12, and our Acceptable Use Policy in particular, shall constitute a material breach; or

(b) to the extent possible under Applicable Laws, if the other Party: (i) becomes insolvent or files, or has filed against it, a petition for voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy or under any other insolvency law; (ii) makes or seeks to make a general assignment for the benefit of its creditors, seeks reorganization, winding-up, liquidation, dissolution, or other similar relief with respect to it or its debts; (iii) applies for, or consents to, the appointment of a trustee, receiver, or custodian for a substantial part of its property; or (iv) is generally unable to pay its debts as they become due.

For the avoidance of doubt, termination pursuant to this Section 13.3 does not affect any other rights or remedies to which the terminating Party may be entitled under this Agreement or Applicable Law and is effective on the nonterminating Party's receipt of notice of termination or any later date set out in such notice.

13.4. Any notice of termination will only be effective if sent to, and received by, the other Party by letter, facsimile, or email. A termination notice is not required provided You terminate by unsubscribing within Your 'Account' page.

13.5. Termination of the Agreement will terminate related licenses granted, unless granted for an indefinite period. In addition, within ten (10) Business Days of the effective date of termination of the Agreement, each Receiving Party shall (i) return to the Disclosing Party, or at the Disclosing Party's option, the Receiving Party shall destroy all items of Confidential Information that relate to the Agreement and is in the Receiving Party's possession or control, including any copies, extracts, or portions thereof, and (ii) upon request, certify in writing to the Disclosing Party that it has complied with the foregoing.

13.7. Any notice of termination will only be effective if sent to, and received by, the other Party by letter, facsimile, or email.

## Section 14: Modifications

14.1. Tuist reserves the right to amend this Agreement, provided that the amendment is reasonable for the Customer and that Tuist takes the Customer's legitimate interests into account within the scope of the amendment. Changes to the subject matter of the Agreement and the main performance obligations that would lead to a change in the nature of the Agreement as a whole are excluded from the right to amend.

14.2. An amendment to the Agreement by Tuist shall be justified, in particular, if Tuist is obliged to ensure that Services comply with Applicable Law, especially if the applicable legal situation changes, or if Tuist is complying with a court order or an official decision through the amendment.

14.3. An amendment to the Agreement initiated by Tuist requires that Tuist notify the Customer of the intended amendment via email, in-app notification, or website posting at least four (4) weeks before the proposed date of entry into force. The Customer shall be deemed to have given consent if the Customer has not notified Tuist of its rejection prior to the proposed date of entry into force of the amendment. Tuist shall be obliged to expressly draw the Customer's attention to the effect of consent by its conduct within the scope of a change request and to separately inform the Customer of the changes in a highlighted manner, e.g., by means of a synoptic comparison, by highlighting the changes in bold, or by means of an addendum to this Agreement.

14.4. If the Customer objects to the new provisions of the Agreement, Tuist shall be entitled to terminate the Agreement or the respective Order without notice.

14.5. If the term of an Agreement automatically renews, or if the Parties enter a new Order referencing the terms of this Agreement, the Customer agrees that the latest version of the Agreement will apply to the respective Orders. If the Customer does not agree to the terms of this Agreement or any renewed version, the Customer may terminate the respective Order.

## Section 15: Miscellaneous

15.1. Tuist may publicly use the Customer's company name (including any related company trademark) solely to identify the Customer as a customer of Tuist. Any other use of one Party's names, logos, or trademarks by the other Party is subject to the one Party's prior written consent.

15.2. Any notice or communication required or permitted under this Agreement shall be in writing and may be delivered by electronic means, including, but not limited to, email, in-app notifications, or electronic signature platforms such as DocuSign. Such electronic communications shall be deemed to be in writing. Notices sent by electronic means shall be considered received upon confirmation of successful transmission or, in the case of electronic signature platforms, upon confirmation of completion of the signing process. All notices to Tuist must be delivered to the email address legal@tuist.dev or to the postal address specified in the Parties Section, unless otherwise specified in this Agreement. All communications and notices under this Agreement shall be in the English language. Notices will be treated as delivered on the date received at the specified address, the date shown on the return receipt, the date of email transmission, or the date on the courier confirmation of delivery, as applicable.

The Parties agree that the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods shall not apply. In the event of a dispute that may arise between the Parties regarding the validity, implementation, interpretation, or termination of the Agreement, to the extent legally permissible, sole jurisdiction is allocated to the competent courts of Berlin, Germany.

15.4. This Agreement does not create any third-party beneficiary rights in any individual or entity that is not a party to this Agreement.

15.5. The Agreement constitutes the sole and entire agreement of the Parties with respect to the subject matter contained herein and therein and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous understandings, agreements, representations, and warranties, both written and oral, regarding such subject matter.

15.6. No term or provision of the ToS or any Order shall be considered waived by a Party, and no breach excused by a Party, unless such waiver or consent is in writing and signed on behalf of the party against whom the waiver is asserted. No consent by a Party to, or waiver of, a breach by a Party, whether express or implied, shall constitute consent to, waiver of, or excuse of any other, different, or subsequent breach by a Party.

15.7. No Party may assign the ToS or any Order except upon the prior written consent of the respective other Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Tuist may assign the ToS and any Order without such consent in connection with a merger, reorganization, acquisition, or other transfer of all or substantially all of Tuist's assets or voting securities. Any attempt to transfer or assign the ToS or any Order except as expressly authorized under this Section 15.7 will be null and void.

15.8. Neither Party will be liable to the other for any delay or failure to perform any obligation under this Agreement (except for a failure to pay fees) if the delay or failure is due to events that are beyond the reasonable control of such Party and could not be avoided through the exercise of reasonable care and diligence, including, but not limited to, any strike, blockade, war, act of terrorism, riot, natural disaster, or failure or diminishment of power or of telecommunications or data networks or services ("**Force Majeure**"). In the event that Force Majeure occurs and persists for a period of thirty (30) days, the Customer may terminate this Agreement by providing written notice to Tuist. In the event Tuist's performance hereunder is affected by Force Majeure, the fees to be paid by Customer will be equitably adjusted to reflect the period of nonperformance.

15.9. This ToS and any Order shall be signed by duly authorized representatives of the Parties and may also be executed in digital form by means of a simple electronic signature. This ToS and any Order may be executed by the exchange of signed copies by facsimile, DocuSign, Adobe Sign, or by the exchange of PDF copies of the Order by email, each such copy constituting an original for each Party whose signature appears thereon, but all copies together constituting one and the same document. An executed DocuSign or PDF copy or scanned electronic copy of the ToS or any Order shall have the same validity and effect as delivery of an original signed copy of the Agreement, and the electronic signature of a Party is to be considered as an original signature.
