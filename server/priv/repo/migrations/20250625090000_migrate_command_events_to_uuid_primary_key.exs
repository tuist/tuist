  @moduledoc """
  This migration transitions the command_events table from using integer IDs to UUID primary keys.

  IMPORTANT: This migration handles both on-premise (PostgreSQL only) and cloud (PostgreSQL + ClickHouse) deployments:
  - On-premise: Updates both command_events and xcode_graphs tables in PostgreSQL
  - Cloud: Updates only command_events table in PostgreSQL; xcode_graphs exists in ClickHouse

  Migration steps:
  1. Add legacy_artifact_path flag to track pre-migration records
  2. Update test_case_runs foreign keys (always in PostgreSQL)
  3. Update xcode_graphs foreign keys (only for on-premise deployments)
  4. Change command_events primary key from (id, created_at) to (uuid, created_at)
  5. Rename columns: id -> legacy_id, uuid -> id, and update primary key to use new id
