### Scroll Indicator
- [ ] Add a scroll indicator circle on the timeline that moves along the vertical line as the user scrolls
- The circle should stick to the viewport top (similar to the sticky dates) and visually travel along the timeline
- Needs to be positioned absolutely to not disrupt the grid layout (3 columns: date, line, entry)
- Should align horizontally with the center of the line column
- Should align vertically with the sticky date position (var(--noora-spacing-6) from viewport top)
