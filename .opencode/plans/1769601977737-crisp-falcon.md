Goal
- Perform a three-agent code review of the `cschmatzler/sqlite-writer` bookmark, ranking findings by severity.

Scope
- Review changes in `bookmark:cschmatzler/sqlite-writer` versus its base branch (likely `main` or `default`).

Planned Approach
- Use jj to identify the bookmark target and base branch, then collect diff/log for that range.
- Read the changed files and any related sqlite writer paths to understand behavior and invariants.
- Run three @code-review subagents in parallel with focused lenses (correctness, performance/concurrency, tests/observability).
- Correlate findings, deduplicate, and rank by severity (critical/high/medium/low/info), then summarize.

Candidate Files (based on initial exploration)
- cache/lib/cache/sqlite_buffer.ex
- cache/lib/cache/sqlite_buffer/prom_ex_plugin.ex
- cache/lib/cache/sqlite_bufferable.ex
- cache/lib/cache/key_value_buffer.ex
- cache/lib/cache/cache_artifacts_buffer.ex
- cache/lib/cache/s3_transfers_buffer.ex
- cache/test/cache/sqlite_buffer_test.exs

Commands to Run (after plan approval)
- `jj bookmark list cschmatzler/sqlite-writer`
- `jj log -r "bookmark:cschmatzler/sqlite-writer"`
- Determine base (`main` or `default`) and run:
  - `jj diff --summary -r "<base>..bookmark:cschmatzler/sqlite-writer"`
  - `jj diff -r "<base>..bookmark:cschmatzler/sqlite-writer"`
  - `jj log -r "<base>..bookmark:cschmatzler/sqlite-writer"`

Verification
- No tests planned in review-only workflow unless requested.
