## Goal
Remove misleading CAS-only naming from the access-tracking buffer operations/logs while keeping the shared `cas_artifacts` table, CAS API, and module cache API unchanged.

## Scope
- Keep SQL table name `cas_artifacts` and Ecto schema unchanged.
- Keep CAS and module cache controllers/routes/telemetry namespaces unchanged.
- Only rename internal buffer operation/state labels and any log/metric strings that expose them.

## Plan
1) Rename buffer operation/state labels used by CacheArtifactsBuffer
   - Update operation atoms and state keys to neutral names (non-CAS-specific):
     - :cas_access -> :artifact_access
     - :cas_accesses -> :artifact_accesses
     - :cas_delete -> :artifact_delete
     - :cas_deletes -> :artifact_deletes
     - state keys cas_accesses/cas_deletes -> artifact_accesses/artifact_deletes
   - Keep buffer_name as :cas_artifacts so table name and any buffer-name metrics remain compatible.
   - File: cache/lib/cache/cache_artifacts_buffer.ex

2) Ensure logs/metrics reflect the renamed operation labels
   - Log line originates from SQLiteBuffer with `operation` label; update any metric/label mapping that exposes operation names if applicable.
   - Files: cache/lib/cache/sqlite_buffer.ex, cache/lib/cache/sqlite_buffer/prom_ex_plugin.ex

3) Update tests for renamed operation/state atoms
   - Search for assertions on :cas_accesses/:cas_deletes or related labels and update to new names.
   - Files: cache/test/**/* (only where relevant)

## Files to Review/Modify
- cache/lib/cache/cache_artifacts_buffer.ex
- cache/lib/cache/sqlite_buffer.ex
- cache/lib/cache/sqlite_buffer/prom_ex_plugin.ex
- cache/test/**/* (as needed)

## Verification
- Run any tests that assert buffer operation names or metrics labels (if present).
