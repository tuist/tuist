Just noticed the actions npm package is not released:
https://github.com/tuist/tuist/actions/runs/21873609263/job/63136189337

Let's change the approach, instead of pushing to the NPM package, I want you to push the new versions to https://github.com/tuist/agent-skills using one of the GitHub tokens that we have as secrets and create the version there. Remove the package.json and the npm publish piece

Can you create a PR with this?
